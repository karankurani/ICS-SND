    :abstractText: We present a novel method and prototype system to help users make sense of and reorganize large amounts of heterogeneous information. Our work is grounded in theories of categorization from cognitive psychology and is designed for ad hoc sensemaking; that is, supporting people's shifting goals and flexible mental representations of concepts. Shiftr adapts a carefully chosen Belief Propagation algorithm from large-scale graph mining to efficiently assist users in interactively clustering information of arbitrary types. The system functions effectively with few human-labeled examples, and supports the use of both positive and negative examples. We demonstrate Shiftr's utility through sensemaking scenarios, one of which uses the DBLP bibliography dataset, which contains more than 1.7 million author-paper relationships.

    :abstractText: Forecasting has attracted a lot of research interest, with very successful methods for periodic time series. Here, we propose a fast, automated method to do non-linear forecasting, for both periodic as well as chaotic time series. We use the technique of delay coordinate embedding, which needs several parameters; our contribution is the automated way of setting these parameters, using the concept of `intrinsic dimensionality'. Our operational system has fast and scalable algorithms for preprocessing and, using R-trees, also has fast methods for forecasting. The result of this work is a black-box which, given a time series as input, finds the best parameter settings, and generates a prediction system. Tests on real and synthetic data show that our system achieves low error, while it can handle arbitrarily large datasets.

    :abstractText: "How to spot abnormalities in a stream of temperature data from a sensor? Or from a network of sensors? How does the Internet look like? Are there 'abnormal' sub-graphs in a given social network, possibly indicating, e.g., money-laundering rings?We present some recent work and list many remaining challenges for these two fascinating issues in data mining, namely, streams and networks. Streams appear in numerous settings, in the form of, e.g., temperature readings, road traffic data, series of video frames for surveillance, patient physiological data. In all these settings, we want to equip the sensors with nimble, but powerful enough algorithms to look for patterns and abnormalities,<ol>(a) on a semi-infinite stream,(b) using finite memory, and (c) without human intervention.</ol.For networks, the applications are also numerous: social networks recording who knows/calls/emails whom; the Internet itself, as well as the Web, with routers and links, or pages and hyper-links; the genes and how they are related; customers and products they buy. In fact, any \"many-to-many\" database relationship eventually leads to a graph/network. In all these settings we want to find patterns and 'abnormalities'; the most central/important nodes; we also want to predict how the network will evolve; and we want to tackle huge graphs, with millions or billions of nodes and edges.As a promising direction towards these problems, we present some surprising tools from the theory of fractals, self-similarity and power laws. We show how the 'intrinsic' or 'fractal' dimension can help us find patterns, when traditional tools and assumptions fail. We show that self-similarity and power laws models work well in an impressive variety of settings, including real, bursty disk and web traffic; skewed distributions of click-streams; and multiple, real Internet graphs."

    :abstractText: Are "tornado" touchdowns related to "earthquakes"? How about to "floods", or to "hurricanes"? In Informedia [14], using a gazetteer on news video clips, we map news onto points on the globe and find correlations between sets of points. In this paper we show how to find answers to such questions, and how to look for patterns on the geo-spatial relationships of news events. The proposed tool is "GeoPlot", which is fast to compute and gives a lot of useful information which traditional text retrieval can not find.We describe our experiments on 2-year worth of video data (~ 20 Gbytes). There we found that GeoPlot can find unexpected correlations that text retrieval would never find, such as those between "earthquake" and "volcano", and "tourism" and "wine".In addition, GeoPlot provides a good visualization of a data set's characteristics. Characteristics at all scales are shown in one plot and a wealth of information is given, for example, geo-spatial clusters, characteristic scales, and intrinsic (fractal) dimensions of the events' locations.

    :abstractText: Existing estimation approaches for multi-dimensional databases often rely on the assumption that data distribution in a small region is uniform, which seldom holds in practice. Moreover, their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certain distance metric. This paper develops the Power-method, a comprehensive technique applicable to a wide range of query optimization problems under various metrics. The Power-method eliminates the local uniformity assumption and is accurate even in scenarios where existing approaches completely fail. Furthermore, it performs estimation by evaluating only one simple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirm that the Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy and applicability to various optimization scenarios.

    :abstractText: Complex data retrieval is accelerated using index structures, which organize the data in order to prune comparisons between data during queries. In metric spaces, comparison operations can be specially expensive, so the pruning ability of indexing methods turns out to be specially meaningful. This paper shows how to measure the pruning power of metric access methods, and defines a new measurement, called "prunability," which indicates how well a pruning technique carries out the task of cutting down distance calculations at each tree level. It also presents a new dynamic access method, aiming to minimize the number of distance calculations required to answer similarity queries. We show that this novel structure is up to 3 times faster and requires less than 25% distance calculations to answer similarity queries, as compared to existing methods. This gain in performance is achieved by taking advantage of a set of global representatives. Although our technique uses multiple representatives, the index structure still remains dynamic and balanced.

    :abstractText: Multimedia and complex data are usually queried by similarity predicates. Whereas there are many works dealing with algorithms to answer basic similarity predicates, there are not generic algorithms able to efficiently handle similarity complex queries combining several basic similarity predicates. In this work we propose a simple and effective set of algorithms that can be combined to answer complex similarity queries, and a set of algebraic rules useful to rewrite similarity query expressions into an adequate format for those algorithms. Those rules and algorithms allow relational database management systems to turn complex queries into efficient query execution plans. We present experiments that highlight interesting scenarios. They show that the proposed algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the traditional similarity algorithms. Moreover, they are linearly scalable considering the database size.

    :abstractText: "A similarity query considers an element as the query center and searches a dataset to find either the elements far up to a bounding radius or the k nearest ones from the query center. Several algorithms have been developed to efficiently execute similarity queries. However, there are queries that require more than one center, which we call Aggregate Similarity Queries. Such queries appear when the user gives multiple desirable examples, and requests data elements that are similar to all of the examples, as in the case of applying relevance feedback. Here we give the first algorithms that can handle aggregate similarity queries on Metric Access Methods (MAM) such as the M-tree and Slim-tree. Our method, which we call Metric Aggregate Similarity Search (MASS) has the following properties: (a) it requires only the triangle inequality property; (b) it guarantees no false-dismissals, as we prove that it lower-bounds the aggregate distance scores; (c) it can work with any MAM; (d) it can handle any number of query centers, which are either scattered all over the space or concentrated on a restricted region. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that our method scales on both the number of elements and, if the dataset is in a spatial domain, also on its dimensionality. Moreover, it achieves better results than previous related methods."

    :abstractText: Given a collection of complex, time-stamped events, how do we find patterns and anomalies? Events could be meetings with one or more persons and one or more agenda items at zero or more locations (e.g., teleconferences), or they could be publications with authors, keywords, publishers, etc. In such settings, we want to find time stamps that look similar to each other and group them; we also want to find anomalies. In addition, we want our approach to provide interpretations of the clusters and anomalies by annotating them. Furthermore, we want our approach to automatically find the right time-granularity in which to do analysis. Lastly, we want fast, scalable algorithms for all these problems. We address the above challenges through two main ideas. The first (T3) is to turn the problem into a graph analysis problem, by carefully treating each time stamp as a node in a graph. This viewpoint brings to bear the vast machinery of graph analysis methods (PageRank, graph partitioning, proximity analysis, and CenterPiece Subgraphs, to name a few). Thus, T3 can automatically group the time stamps into meaningful clusters and spot anomalies. Moreover, it can select representative events/persons/locations for each cluster and each anomaly, as their interpretations. The second idea (MT3) is to use temporal multi-resolution analysis (e.g., minutes, hours, days). We show that MT3 can quickly derive results from finer-to-coarser resolutions, achieving up to 2 orders of magnitude speedups. We verify the effectiveness as well as efficiency of T3 and MT3 on several real datasets.

    :abstractText: How do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How can we generate realistic-looking graphs? We review some static and temporal 'laws', and we describe the ``Kronecker'' graph generator, which naturally matches all of the known properties of real graphs. We also describe some case studies. The first is on influence and virus propagation on real graphs, where we show that the so-called ``epidemic threshold'' of a graph depends only on the first eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The second shows how to spot patterns in e-bay interaction graphs, indicative of the ``non-delivery'' type of fraud. The last is analysis on blog cascades and some surprising patterns there.

In this paper, we propose a novel, graph-based approach (GCap) which outperforms previously reported methods for automatic image captioning. Moreover, it is fast and scales well, with its training and testing time linear to the data set size. We report auto-captioning experiments on the "standard" Corel image database of 680 MBytes, where GCap outperforms recent, successful auto-captioning methods by up to 10 percentage points in captioning accuracy (50% relative improvement).

    :abstractText: Provisioning a storage system requires balancing the costs of the solution with the benefits that the solution will provide. Previous provisioning approaches have started with a fixed set of requirements and the goal of automatically finding minimum cost solutions to meet them. Such approaches neglect the cost-benefit analysis of the purchasing decision. Purchasing a storage system involves an extensive set of trade-offs between metrics such as purchase cost, performance, reliability, availability, power, etc. Increases in one metric have consequences for others, and failing to account for these trade-offs can lead to a poor return on the storage investment. Using a collection of storage acquisition and provisioning scenarios, we show that utility functions enable this cost-benefit structure to be conveyed to an automated provisioning tool, enabling the tool to make appropriate trade-offs between different system metrics including performance, data protection, and purchase cost.

    :abstractText: "With the deeply-ingrained notion that disks can efficiently access only one dimensional data, current approaches for mapping multidimensional data to disk blocks either allow efficient accesses in only one dimension, trading off the efficiency of accesses in other dimensions, or equally penalize access to all dimensions. Yet, existing technology and functions readily available inside disk firmware can identify non-contiguous logical blocks that preserve spatial locality of multidimensional datasets. These blocks, which span on the order of a hundred adjacent tracks, can be accessed with minimal positioning cost. This paper details these technologies, analyzes their trends, and shows how they can be exposed to applications while maintaining existing abstractions. The described approach can achieve the best possible access efficiency afforded by the disk technologies: sequential access along primary dimension and access with minimal positioning cost for all other dimensions. Experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation demonstrates a reduction of overall I/O time for multi-dimensional data queries between 30% and 50% when compared to existing approaches."

    :abstractText: Much of the motion capture data used in animations, commercials, and video games is carefully segmented into distinct motions either at the time of capture or by hand after the capture session. As we move toward collecting more and longer motion sequences, however, automatic segmentation techniques will become important for processing the results in a reasonable time frame.We have found that straightforward, easy to implement segmentation techniques can be very effective for segmenting motion sequences into distinct behaviors. In this paper, we present three approaches for automatic segmentation. The first two approaches are online, meaning that the algorithm traverses the motion from beginning to end, creating the segmentation as it proceeds. The first assigns a cut when the intrinsic dimensionality of a local model of the motion suddenly increases. The second places a cut when the distribution of poses is observed to change. The third approach is a batch process and segments the sequence where consecutive frames belong to different elements of a Gaussian mixture model. We assess these three methods on fourteen motion sequences and compare the performance of the automatic methods to that of transitions selected manually.

    :abstractText: Fraud detection has become a common concern of the online auction websites. Fraudsters often manipulate reputation systems and commit non- delivery fraud. To deal with fraud in group behavior we consider network level features, such as users' beliefs of other users. In this paper we use the loopy belief propagation algorithm and apply it to network level fraud detection, classifying fraudsters, accomplices, as well as honest users. Our method shows good classification accuracy using real data.

    :abstractText: Describes the design and implementation of QBlSM (Query By Interactive, Spatial Multimedia), a prototype for querying and visualizing 3D spatial data. The first application is in an area in medical research, in particular, Functional Brain Mapping. The system is built on top of the Starburst DBMS extended to handle spatial data types, specifically, scalar fields and arbitrary regions of space within such fields. The authors list the requirements of the application, discuss the logical and physical database design issues, and present timing results from their prototype. They observed that the DBMS' early spatial filtering results in significant performance savings because the system response time is dominated by the amount of data retrieved, transmitted, and rendered

    :abstractText: Efficiently and accurately searching for similarities among time series and discovering interesting patterns is an important and non-trivial problem. In this paper, we introduce a new representation of time series, the Multiresolution Vector Quantized (MVQ) approximation, along with a new distance function. The novelty of MVQ is that it keeps both local and global information about the original time series in a hierarchical mechanism, processing the original time series at multiple resolutions. Moreover, the proposed representation is symbolic employing key subsequences and potentially allows the application of text-based retrieval techniques into the similarity analysis of time series. The proposed method is fast and scales linearly with the size of database and the dimensionality. Contrary to the vast majority in the literature that uses the Euclidean distance, MVQ uses a multi-resolution/hierarchical distance function. We performed experiments with real and synthetic data. The proposed distance function consistently outperforms all the major competitors (Euclidean, Dynamic Time Warping, Piecewise Aggregate Approximation) achieving up to 20% better precision/recall and clustering accuracy on the tested datasets.

In particular, how can we detect the underlying correlations (latent variables) among many co-evolving sensor measurements? Can we do it incrementally? We present a system that can (1) collect the measurements from the real wireless sensors; (2) process them in real-time; and (3) determine the correlations (latent variables) among the sensor streams on the fly.

    :abstractText: "Given publication titles and authors, what can we say about the evolution of scientific topics and communities over time? Which communities shrunk, which emerged, and which split, over time? And, when in time were the turning points? We propose TimeFall, which can automatically answer these questions given a social network/graph that evolves over time. The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it needs no user-defined parameters, relying instead on the principle of Minimum Description Length (MDL), to extract the communities, and to find good cut-points in time when communities change abruptly: a cut-point is good, if it leads to shorter data description. We illustrate our algorithm on synthetic and large real datasets, and we show that the results of the TimeFall agree with human intuition."

    :abstractText: "Similarity joins have attracted significant interest, with applications in Geographical Information Systems, astronomy, marketing analyzes, and anomaly detection. However, all the past algorithms, although highly fine-tuned, suffer an output explosion if the query range is even moderately large relative to the local data density. Under such circumstances, the response time and the search effort are both almost quadratic in the database size, which is often prohibitive. We solve this problem by providing two algorithms that find a compact representation of the similarity join result, while retaining all the information in the standard join. Our algorithms have the following characteristics: (a) they are at least as fast as the standard similarity join algorithm, and typically much faster, (b) they generate significantly smaller output, (c) they provably lose no information, (d) they scale well to large data sets, and (e) they can be applied to any of the standard tree data structures. Experiments on real and realistic point-sets show that our algorithms are up to several orders of magnitude faster."

    :abstractText: "Given a large collection of medical images of several conditions and treatments, how can we succinctly describe the characteristics of each setting? For example, given a large collection of retinal images from several different experimental conditions (normal, detached, reattached, etc.), how can data mining help biologists focus on important regions in the images or on the differences between different experimental conditions? If the images were text documents, we could find the main terms and concepts for each condition by existing IR methods (e.g., tf/idf and LSI). We propose something analogous, but for the much more challenging case of an image collection: We propose to automatically develop a visual vocabulary by breaking images into n \xC3\x97 n tiles and deriving key tiles (\"ViVos\") for each image and condition. We experiment with numerous domain-independent ways of extracting features from tiles (color histograms, textures, etc.), and several ways of choosing characteristic tiles (PCA, ICA). We perform experiments on two disparate biomedical datasets. The quantitative measure of success is classification accuracy: Our \"ViVos\" achieve high classification accuracy (up to 83% for a nine-class problem on feline retinal images). More importantly, qualitatively, our \"ViVos\" do an excellent job as \"visual vocabulary terms\": they have biological meaning, as corroborated by domain experts; they help spot characteristic regions of images, exactly like text vocabulary terms do for documents; and they highlight the differences between pairs of images."

    :abstractText: We propose multi-modal story-oriented video summarization (MMSS) which, unlike previous works that use fine-tuned, domain-specific heuristics, provides a domain-independent, graph-based framework. MMSS uncovers correlation between information of different modalities which gives meaningful story-oriented news video summaries. MMSS can also be applied for video retrieval, giving performance that matches the best traditional retrieval techniques (OKAPI and LSI), with no fine-tuned heuristics such as tf/idf.

We propose a method that simultaneously finds spatial correlation and feature co-occurrence patterns, without any parameters. In particular, we employ the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle coupled with a natural way of compressing regions. This defines what \"good\" means: a feature co-occurrence pattern is good, if it helps us better compress the set of locations for these features. Conversely, a spatial correlation is good, if it helps us better compress the set of features in the corresponding region. Our approach is scalable for large datasets (both number of locations and of features). We evaluate our method on both real and synthetic datasets."

We introduce two operations on bipartite graphs: 1) identifying similar nodes (Neighborhood formation), and 2) finding abnormal nodes (Anomaly detection). And we propose algorithms to compute the neighborhood for each node using random walk with restarts and graph partitioning; we also propose algorithms to identify abnormal nodes, using neighborhood information. We evaluate the quality of neighborhoods based on semantics of the datasets, and we also measure the performance of the anomaly detection algorithm with manually injected anomalies. Both effectiveness and efficiency of the methods are confirmed by experiments on several real datasets."

    :abstractText: Detecting outliers is an important problem. Most of its applications typically possess high dimensional datasets. In high dimensional space, the data becomes sparse which implies that every object can be regarded as an outlier from the point of view of similarity. Furthermore, a fundamental issue is that the notion of which objects are outliers typically varies between users, problem domains or, even, datasets. In this paper, we present a novel robust solution which detects high dimensional outliers based on user examples and tolerates incorrect inputs. It studies the behavior of projections of such a few examples, to discover further objects that are outstanding in the projection where many examples are outlying. Our experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to detect outliers corresponding to the user examples.

    :abstractText: "How closely related are two nodes in a graph? How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the \"connection subgraphs\", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) blockwise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150x speed up with 90%+ quality preservation."

    :abstractText: How do real, weighted graphs change over time? What patterns, if any, do they obey? Earlier studies focus on unweighted graphs, and, with few exceptions, they focus on static snapshots. Here, we report patterns we discover on several real, weighted, time-evolving graphs. The reported patterns can help in detecting anomalies in natural graphs, in making link prediction and in providing more criteria for evaluation of synthetic graph generators. We further propose an intuitive and easy way to construct weighted, time-evolving graphs. In fact, we prove that our generator will produce graphs which obey many patterns and laws observed to date. We also provide empirical evidence to support our claims.

    :abstractText: "We present Graphite, a system that allows the user to visually construct a query pattern, finds both its exact and approximate matching subgraphs in large attributed graphs, and visualizes the matches. For example, in a social network where a person's occupation is an attribute, the user can draw a 'star' query for \"finding a CEO who has interacted with a Secretary, a Manager, and an Accountant, or a structure very similar to this\". Graphite uses the G-Ray algorithm to run the query against a user-chosen data graph, gaining all of its benefits, namely its high speed, scalability, and its ability to find both exact and near matches. Therefore, for the example above, Graphite tolerates indirect paths between, say, the CEO and the Accountant, when no direct path exists. Graphite uses fast algorithms to estimate node proximities when finding matches, enabling it to scale well with the graph database size.We demonstrate Graphite\xE2\x80\x99s usage and benefits using the DBLP author-publication graph, which consists of 356K nodes and 1.9M edges.

    :abstractText: Given a large, real graph, how can we generate a synthetic graph that matches its properties, i.e., it has similar degree distribution, similar (small) diameter, similar spectrum, etc? We propose to use "Kronecker graphs", which naturally obey all of the above properties, and we present KronFit, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to real networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, KronFit takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker product and by using sampling. Experiments on large real and synthetic graphs show that KronFit indeed mimics very well the patterns found in the target graphs. Once fitted, the model parameters and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization.

    :abstractText: From data mining to computer vision, from visual surveillance to biometrics research, from biomedical imaging to bioinformatics, and from multimedia retrieval to information management, a large amount of data are naturally represented by multidimensional arrays, i.e., tensors. However, conventional probabilistic graphical models with probabilistic inference only model data in vector format, although they are very important in many statistical problems, e.g., model selection. Is it possible to construct multilinear probabilistic graphical models for tensor format data to conduct probabilistic inference, e.g., model selection? This paper provides a positive answer based on the proposed decoupled probabilistic model by developing the probabilistic tensor analysis (PTA), which selects suitable model for tensor format data modeling based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Empirical studies demonstrate that PTA associated with AIC and BIC selects correct number of models.

    :abstractText: How do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How can we generate realistic-looking graphs? We review some static and temporal 'laws,' and we describe the "Kronecker" graph generator, which naturally matches all of the known properties of real graphs. Moreover, we present tools for discovering anomalies and patterns in two types of graphs, static and time-evolving. For the former, we present the 'CenterPiece' subgraphs (CePS), which expects q query nodes (eg., suspicious and finds the node that is best connected to all q of them (eg., the master mind of a criminal group). We also show how to compute CenterPiece subgraphs efficiently. For the time evolving graphs, we present tensor-based methods, and apply them on real data, like the DBLP author-paper dataset, where they are able to find natural research communities, and track their evolution. Finally, we also briefly mention some results on influence and virus propagation on real graphs, as well as on the emerging map/reduce approach and its impact on large graph mining.

    :abstractText: "Given a large social or computer network, how can we visualize it, find patterns, outliers, communities? Although several graph visualization tools exist, they cannot handle large graphs with hundred thousand nodes and possibly million edges. Such graphs bring two challenges: interactive visualization demands prohibitive processing power and, even if we could interactively update the visualization, the user would be overwhelmed by the excessive number of graphical items. To cope with this problem, we propose a formal innovation on the use of graph hierarchies that leads to GMine system. GMine promotes scalability using a hierarchy of graph partitions, promotes concomitant presentation for the graph hierarchy and for the original graph, and extends analytical possibilities with the integration of the graph partitions in an interactive environment."

    :abstractText: "Motivation: Protein complexes integrate multiple gene products to coordinate many biological functions. Given a graph representing pairwise protein interaction data one can search for subgraphs representing protein complexes. Previous methods for performing such search relied on the assumption that complexes form a clique in that graph. While this assumption is true for some complexes, it does not hold for many others. New algorithms are required in order to recover complexes with other types of topological structure. Results: We present an algorithm for inferring protein complexes from weighted interaction graphs. By using graph topological patterns and biological properties as features, we model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN). We use a training set of known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN model. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN is then used to score subgraphs in the protein interaction graph and identify new complexes. We applied our method to protein interaction data in yeast. As we show our algorithm achieved a considerable improvement over clique based algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known complexes. We discuss some of the new complexes predicted by our algorithm and determine that they likely represent true complexes.

    :abstractText: "How do we find a natural clustering of a real world point set, which contains an unknown number of clusters with different shapes, and which may be contaminated by noise? Most clustering algorithms were designed with certain assumptions (Gaussianity), they often require the user to give input parameters, and they are sensitive to noise. In this paper, we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given data set, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed framework, Robust Information-theoretic Clustering (RIC), is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm: given a preliminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods such as grid-based space partitioning. Moreover, RIC scales well with the data set size. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world data sets validate the proposed RIC framework."

    :abstractText: Hidden variables, evolving over time, appear in multiple settings, where it is valuable to recover them, typically from observed sums. Our driving application is 'network tomography', where we need to estimate the origin-destination (OD) traffic flows to determine, e.g., who is communicating with whom in a local area network. This information allows network engineers and managers to solve problems in design, routing, configuration debugging, monitoring and pricing. Unfortunately the direct measurement of the OD traffic is usually difficult, or even impossible; instead, we can easily measure the loads on every link, that is, sums of desirable OD flows.In this paper we propose i-FILTER, a method to solve this problem, which improves the state-of-the-art by (a) introducing explicit time dependence, and by (b) using realistic, non-Gaussian marginals in the statistical models for the traffic flows, as never attempted before. We give experiments on real data, where i-FILTER scales linearly with new observations and out-performs the best existing solutions, in a wide variety of settings. Specifically, on real network traffic measured at CMU, and at AT&T, i-FILTER reduced the estimation errors between 15% and 46% in all cases.

    :abstractText: Skewed distributions appear very often in practice. Unfortunately, the traditional Zipf distribution often fails to model them well. In this paper, we propose a new probability distribution, the Discrete Gaussian Exponential (DGX), to achieve excellent fits in a wide variety of settings; our new distribution includes the Zipf distribution as a special case. We present a statistically sound method for estimating the DGX parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We applied DGX to a wide variety of real world data sets, such as sales data from a large retailer chain, us-age data from AT&T, and Internet clickstream data; in all cases, DGX fits these distributions very well, with almost a 99% correlation coefficient in quantile-quantile plots. Our algorithm also scales very well because it requires only a single pass over the data. Finally, we illustrate the power of DGX as a new tool for data mining tasks, such as outlier detection.

    :abstractText: Large, sparse binary matrices arise in numerous data mining applications, such as the analysis of market baskets, web graphs, social networks, co-citations, as well as information retrieval, collaborative filtering, sparse matrix reordering, etc. Virtually all popular methods for the analysis of such matrices---e.g., k-means clustering, METIS graph partitioning, SVD/PCA and frequent itemset mining---require the user to specify various parameters, such as the number of clusters, number of principal components, number of partitions, and "support." Choosing suitable values for such parameters is a challenging problem.Cross-association is a joint decomposition of a binary matrix into disjoint row and column groups such that the rectangular intersections of groups are homogeneous. Starting from first principles, we furnish a clear, information-theoretic criterion to choose a good cross-association as well as its parameters, namely, the number of row and column groups. We provide scalable algorithms to approach the optimal. Our algorithm is parameter-free, and requires no user intervention. In practice it scales linearly with the problem size, and is thus applicable to very large matrices. Finally, we present experiments on multiple synthetic and real-life datasets, where our method gives high-quality, intuitive results.

    :abstractText: We define a connection subgraph as a small subgraph of a large graph that best captures the relationship between two nodes. The primary motivation for this work is to provide a paradigm for exploration and knowledge discovery in large social networks graphs. We present a formal definition of this problem, and an ideal solution based on electricity analogues. We then show how to accelerate the computations, to produce approximate, but high-quality connection subgraphs in real time on very large (disk resident) graphs.We describe our operational prototype, and we demonstrate results on a social network graph derived from the World Wide Web. Our graph contains 15 million nodes and 96 million edges, and our system still produces quality responses within seconds.

    :abstractText: "Given a huge real graph, how can we derive a representative sample? There are many known algorithms to compute interesting measures (shortest paths, centrality, betweenness, etc.), but several of them become impractical for large graphs. Thus graph sampling is essential.The natural questions to ask are (a) which sampling method to use, (b) how small can the sample size be, and (c) how to scale up the measurements of the sample (e.g., the diameter), to get estimates for the large graph. The deeper, underlying question is subtle: how do we measure success?.We answer the above questions, and test our answers by thorough experiments on several, diverse datasets, spanning thousands nodes and edges. We consider several sampling methods, propose novel methods to check the goodness of sampling, and develop a set of scaling laws that describe relations between the properties of the original and the sample.In addition to the theoretical contributions, the practical conclusions from our work are: Sampling strategies based on edge selection do not perform well; simple uniform random node selection performs surprisingly well. Overall, best performing methods are the ones based on random-walks and \"forest fire\"; they match very accurately both static as well as evolutionary graph patterns, with sample sizes down to about 15% of the original graph."

    :abstractText: How do real graphs evolve over time? What are "normal" growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a "forest fire" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the "flammability" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.

    :abstractText: Graphs are an increasingly important data source, with such important graphs as the Internet and the Web. Other familiar graphs include CAD circuits, phone records, gene sequences, city streets, social networks and academic citations. Any kind of relationship, such as actors appearing in movies, can be represented as a graph. This work presents a data mining tool, called ANF, that can quickly answer a number of interesting questions on graph-represented data, such as the following. How robust is the Internet to failures? What are the most influential database papers? Are there gender differences in movie appearance patterns? At its core, ANF is based on a fast and memory-efficient approach for approximating the complete "neighbourhood function" for a graph. For the Internet graph (268K nodes), ANF's highly-accurate approximation is more than 700 times faster than the exact computation. This reduces the running time from nearly a day to a matter of a minute or two, allowing users to perform ad hoc drill-down tasks and to repeatedly answer questions about changing data sources. To enable this drill-down, ANF employs new techniques for approximating neighbourhood-type functions for graphs with distinguished nodes and/or edges. When compared to the best existing approximation, ANF's approach is both faster and more accurate, given the same resources. Additionally, unlike previous approaches, ANF scales gracefully to handle disk resident graphs. Finally, we present some of our results from mining large graphs using ANF.

We perform experiments on the largest publicly available collection of Drosophila ISH (in situ hybridization) images, showing that our FEMine system achieves excellent performance in classification, clustering, and content-based image retrieval. The major innovation of FEMine is the use of automatically discovered latent spatial "themes" of gene expressions, LGEs, in the whole-embryo context, as opposed to patterns in nearly disjoint portions of an embryo proposed in previous methods.

    :abstractText: Given an image (or video clip, or audio song), how do we automatically assign keywords to it? The general problem is to find correlations across the media in a collection of multimedia objects like video clips, with colors, and/or motion, and/or audio, and/or text scripts. We propose a novel, graph-based approach, "MMG", to discover such cross-modal correlations.Our "MMG" method requires no tuning, no clustering, no user-determined constants; it can be applied to any multimedia collection, as long as we have a similarity function for each medium; and it scales linearly with the database size. We report auto-captioning experiments on the "standard" Corel image database of 680 MB, where it outperforms domain specific, fine-tuned methods by up to 10 percentage points in captioning accuracy (50% relative improvement).

    :abstractText: Existing axis scaling and dimensionality methods focus on preserving structure, usually determined via the Euclidean distance. In other words, they inherently assume that the Euclidean distance is already correct. We instead propose a novel nonlinear approach driven by an information-theoretic viewpoint, which we show is also strongly linked to intrinsic dimensionality, or degrees of freedom; and uniformity. Nonlinear transformations based on common probability distributions, combined with information-driven selection, simultaneously reduce the number of dimensions required and increase the value of those we retain. Experiments on real data confirm that this approach reveals correlations, finds novel attributes, and scales well.

    :abstractText: How do we find patterns in author-keyword associations, evolving over time? Or in Data Cubes, with product-branch-customer sales information? Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks and many more. However, they have only two orders, like author and keyword, in the above example.We propose to envision such higher order data as tensors,and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce the dynamic tensor analysis (DTA) method, and its variants. DTA provides a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and it also reveals the hidden correlations. Algorithmically, we designed DTA very carefully so that it is (a) scalable, (b) space efficient (it does not need to store the past) and (c) fully automatic with no need for user defined parameters. Moreover, we propose STA, a streaming tensor analysis method, which provides a fast, streaming approximation to DTA.We implemented all our methods, and applied them in two real settings, namely, anomaly detection and multi-way latent semantic indexing. We used two real, large datasets, one on network flow data (100GB over 1 month) and one from DBLP (200MB over 25 years). Our experiments show that our methods are fast, accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.

    :abstractText: "Given Q nodes in a social network (say, authorship network), how can we find the node/author that is the center-piece, and has direct or indirect connections to all, or most of them? For example, this node could be the common advisor, or someone who started the research area that the Q nodes belong to. Isomorphic scenarios appear in law enforcement (find the master-mind criminal, connected to all current suspects), gene regulatory networks (find the protein that participates in pathways with all or most of the given Q proteins), viral marketing and many more.Connection subgraphs is an important first step, handling the case of Q=2 query nodes. Then, the connection subgraph algorithm finds the b intermediate nodes, that provide a good connection between the two original query nodes.Here we generalize the challenge in multiple dimensions: First, we allow more than two query nodes. Second, we allow a whole family of queries, ranging from 'OR' to 'AND', with 'softAND' in-between. Finally, we design and compare a fast approximation, and study the quality/speed trade-off.We also present experiments on the DBLP dataset. The experiments confirm that our proposed method naturally deals with multi-source queries and that the resulting subgraphs agree with our intuition. Wall-clock timing results on the DBLP dataset show that our proposed approximation achieve good accuracy for about 6:1 speedup."

    :abstractText: "We focus on the problem of finding patterns across two large, multidimensional datasets. For example, given feature vectors of healthy and of non-healthy patients, we want to answer the following questions: Are the two clouds of points separable? What is the smallest/largest pair-wise distance across the two datasets? Which of the two clouds does a new point (feature vector) come from?We propose a new tool, the tri-plot, and its generalization, the pq-plot, which help us answer the above questions. We provide a set of rules on how to interpret a tri-plot, and we apply these rules on synthetic and real datasets. We also show how to use our tool for classification, when traditional methods (nearest neighbor, classification trees) may fail."

    :abstractText: How can we find communities in dynamic networks of socialinteractions, such as who calls whom, who emails whom, or who sells to whom? How can we spot discontinuity time-points in such streams of graphs, in an on-line, any-time fashion? We propose GraphScope, that addresses both problems, using information theoretic principles. Contrary to the majority of earlier methods, it needs no user-defined parameters. Moreover, it is designed to operate on large graphs, in a streaming fashion. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our GraphScope on real datasets from several diverse domains. In all cases it produces meaningful time-evolving patterns that agree with human intuition.

    :abstractText: We focus on large graphs where nodes have attributes, such as a social network where the nodes are labelled with each person's job title. In such a setting, we want to find subgraphs that match a user query pattern. For example, a "star" query would be, "find a CEO who has strong interactions with a Manager, a Lawyer,and an Accountant, or another structure as close to that as possible". Similarly, a "loop" query could help spot a money laundering ring. Traditional SQL-based methods, as well as more recent graph indexing methods, will return no answer when an exact match does not exist. This is the first main feature of our method. It can find exact-, as well as near-matches, and it will present them to the user in our proposed "goodness" order. For example, our method tolerates indirect paths between, say, the "CEO" and the "Accountant" of the above sample query, when direct paths don't exist. Its second feature is scalability. In general, if the query has nq nodes and the data graph has n nodes, the problem needs polynomial time complexity O(n n q), which is prohibitive. Our G-Ray ("Graph X-Ray") method finds high-quality subgraphs in time linear on the size of the data graph. Experimental results on the DLBP author-publication graph (with 356K nodes and 1.9M edges) illustrate both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach. The results agree with our intuition, and the speed is excellent. It takes 4 seconds on average fora 4-node query on the DBLP graph.

    :abstractText: "The problem of multimodal data mining in a multimedia database can be addressed as a structured prediction problem where we learn the mapping from an input to the structured and interdependent output variables. In this paper, built upon the existing literature on the max margin based learning, we develop a new max margin learning approach called Enhanced Max Margin Learning (EMML) framework. In addition, we apply EMML framework to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem in a multimedia database. The main contributions include: (1) we have developed a new max margin learning approach - the enhanced max margin learning framework that is much more efficient in learning with a much faster convergence rate, which is verified in empirical evaluations; (2) we have applied this EMML approach to developing an effective and efficient solution to the multimodal data mining problem that is highly scalable in the sense that the query response time is independent of the database scale, allowing facilitating a multimodal data mining querying to a very large scale multimedia database,and excelling many existing multimodal data mining methods in the literature that do not scale up at all; this advantage is also supported through the complexity analysis as well as empirical evaluations against a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method from the literature. While EMML is a general framework, for the evaluation purpose, we apply it to the Berkeley Drosophila embryo image database, and report the performance comparison with a state-of-the-art multimodal data mining method."

    :abstractText: In this paper we study asymmetric proximity measures on directed graphs, which quantify the relationships between two nodes or two groups of nodes. The measures are useful in several graph mining tasks, including clustering, link prediction and connection subgraph discovery. Our proximity measure is based on the conceptof escape probability. This way, we strive to summarize the multiple facets of nodes-proximity, while avoiding some of the pitfalls to which alternative proximity measures are susceptible. A unique feature of the measures is accounting for the underlying directional information. We put a special emphasis on computational efficiency, and develop fast solutions that are applicable in several settings. Our experimental study shows the usefulness of our proposed direction-aware proximity method for several applications, and that our algorithms achieve a significant speedup (up to 50,000x) over straight forward implementations.

    :abstractText: "Given a water distribution network, where should we place sensors toquickly detect contaminants? Or, which blogs should we read to avoid missing important stories?. These seemingly different problems share common structure: Outbreak detection can be modeled as selecting nodes (sensor locations, blogs) in a network, in order to detect the spreading of a virus or information asquickly as possible. We present a general methodology for near optimal sensor placement in these and related problems. We demonstrate that many realistic outbreak detection objectives (e.g., detection likelihood, population affected) exhibit the property of \"submodularity\". We exploit submodularity to develop an efficient algorithm that scales to large problems, achieving near optimal placements, while being 700 times faster than a simple greedy algorithm. We also derive online bounds on the quality of the placements obtained by any algorithm. Our algorithms and bounds also handle cases where nodes (sensor locations, blogs) have different costs. We evaluate our approach on several large real-world problems,including a model of a water distribution network from the EPA, andreal blog data. The obtained sensor placements are provably near optimal, providing a constant fraction of the optimal solution. We show that the approach scales, achieving speedups and savings in storage of several orders of magnitude. We also show how the approach leads to deeper insights in both applications, answering multicriteria trade-off, cost-sensitivity and generalization questions."

A large fraction of time spent online by a user is directly influence by the social networks to which he/she belongs. This calls for a deeper examination of social networks as large-scale dynamic objects that foster efficient person-person interaction. The goal of our panel is to discuss social networks from various research angles. In particular, we plan to focus on the following broad research-related topics: large scale data mining, algorithmic questions, sociological aspects, privacy, web search, etc. We will also discuss the business and societal impacts of social networks. Each of these topics has generated a lot of research in recent years and while taking stock of what has been done, we will also be discussing the directions in which these topics are headed, from both science and society points of view. Our panel will consist of eminent researchers, who have worked/been working on an eclectic and diverse mix of problems in social networks"

    :abstractText: "Low-rank approximations of the adjacency matrix of a graph are essential in finding patterns (such as communities) and detecting anomalies. Additionally, it is desirable to track the low-rank structure as the graph evolves over time, efficiently and within limited storage. Real graphs typically have thousands or millions of nodes, but are usually very sparse. However, standard decompositions such as SVD do not preserve sparsity. This has led to the development of methods such as CUR and CMD, which seek a non-orthogonal basis by sampling the columns and/or rows of the sparse matrix. However, these approaches will typically produce overcomplete bases, which wastes both space and time. In this paper we propose the family of Colibri methods to deal with these challenges. Our version for static graphs, Colibri-S, iteratively finds a non-redundant basis and we prove that it has no loss of accuracy compared to the best competitors (CUR and CMD), while achieving significant savings in space and time: on real data, Colibri-S requires much less space and is orders of magnitude faster (in proportion to the square of the number of non-redundant columns). Additionally, we propose an efficient update algorithm for dynamic, time-evolving graphs, Colibri-D. Our evaluation on a large, real network traffic dataset shows that Colibri-D is over 100 times faster than the best published competitor (CMD)."

    :abstractText: "We address the problem of classification in partially labeled networks (a.k.a. within-network classification) where observed class labels are sparse. Techniques for statistical relational learning have been shown to perform well on network classification tasks by exploiting dependencies between class labels of neighboring nodes. However, relational classifiers can fail when unlabeled nodes have too few labeled neighbors to support learning (during training phase) and/or inference (during testing phase). This situation arises in real-world problems when observed labels are sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to within-network classification that combines aspects of statistical relational learning and semi-supervised learning to improve classification performance in sparse networks. Our approach works by adding \"ghost edges\" to a network, which enable the flow of information from labeled to unlabeled nodes. Through experiments on real-world data sets, we demonstrate that our approach performs well across a range of conditions where existing approaches, such as collective classification and semi-supervised learning, fail. On all tasks, our approach improves area under the ROC curve (AUC) by up to 15 points over existing approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach runs in time proportional to L \xE2\x80\xA2 E, where L is the number of labeled nodes and E is the number of edges."

We study numerous diverse, real graphs (citation networks, networks in social media, internet traffic, and others); and make the following contributions: (a) we observe that the non-giant connected components seem to stabilize in size, (b) we observe the weights on the edges follow several power laws with surprising exponents, and (c) we propose an intuitive, generative model for graph growth that obeys observed patterns."

    :abstractText: We analyze a massive social network, gathered from the records of a large mobile phone operator, with more than a million users and tens of millions of calls. We examine the distributions of the number of phone calls per customer; the total talk minutes per customer; and the distinct number of calling partners per customer. We find that these distributions are skewed, and that they significantly deviate from what would be expected by power-law and lognormal distributions. To analyze our observed distributions (of number of calls, distinct call partners, and total talk time), we propose PowerTrack , a method which fits a lesser known but more suitable distribution, namely the Double Pareto LogNormal (DPLN) distribution, to our data and track its parameters over time. Using PowerTrack , we find that our graph changes over time in a way consistent with a generative process that naturally results in the DPLN distributions we observe. Furthermore, we show that this generative process lends itself to a natural and appealing social wealth interpretation in the context of social networks such as ours. We discuss the application of those results to our model and to forecasting.

    :abstractText: Multi-core processors with ever increasing number of cores per chip are becoming prevalent in modern parallel computing. Our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up data mining algorithms. Specifically, we present a parallel algorithm for approximate learning of Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS), also known as Kalman Filters (KF). LDSs are widely used in time series analysis such as motion capture modeling, visual tracking etc. We propose Cut-And-Stitch (CAS), a novel method to handle the data dependencies from the chain structure of hidden variables in LDS, so as to parallelize the EM-based parameter learning algorithm. We implement the algorithm using OpenMP on both a supercomputer and a quad-core commercial desktop. The experimental results show that parallel algorithms using Cut-And-Stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the serial version. In addition, Cut-And-Stitch can be generalized to other models with similar linear structures such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Switching Kalman Filters (SKF).

This work explores the application of a machine learning tool, CART models, to storage device modeling. Our approach predicts a device\xC3\xBDs performance as a function of input workloads, requiring no knowledge of the device internals. We propose two uses of CART models: one that predicts per-request response times (and then derives aggregate values) and one that predicts aggregate values directly from workload characteristics. After being trained on the device in question, both provide accurate black-box models across a range of test traces from real environments. Experiments show that these models predict the average and 90th percentile response time with a relative error as low as 19%, when the training workloads are similar to the testing workloads, and interpolate well across different workloads."

    :abstractText: This paper proposes a probabilistic approach for unsupervised modeling and recognition of object categories which combines two types of complementary visual evidence, visual contents and inter-connected links between the images. By doing so, our approach not only increases modeling and recognition performance but also provides possible solutions to several problems including modeling of geometric information, computational complexity, and the inherent ambiguity of visual words. Our approach can be incorporated in any generative models, but here we consider two popular models, pLSA and LDA. Experimental results show that the topic models updated by adding link analysis terms significantly improve the standard pLSA and LDA models. Furthermore, we presented competitive performances on unsupervised modeling, ranking of training images, classification of unseen images, and localization tasks with MSRC and PASCAL2005 datasets.

    :abstractText: Similarity or distance measures are fundamental and critical properties for data mining tools. Categorical attributes abound in databases. The Car Make, Gender, Occupation, etc. fields in a automobile insurance database are very informative. Sadly, categorical data is not easily amenable to similarity computations. A domain expert might manually specify some or all of the similarity relationships, but this is error-prone and not feasible for attributes with large domains, nor is it useful for cross-attribute similarities, such as between Gender and Occupation. External similarity functions define a similarity between, say, Car Makes by looking at how they co-occur with the other categorical attributes. We exploit a rich duality between random walks on graphs and electrical circuits to develop REP, an external similarity function. REP is theoretically grounded while the only prior work was ad-hoc. The usefulness of REP is shown in two experiments. First, we cluster categorical attribute values showing improved inferred relationships. Second, we use REP effectively as a nearest neighbour classifier.

    :abstractText: How do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How can we generate realistic-looking graphs? We review some static and temporal 'laws,' and we describe the "Kronecker" graph generator, which naturally matches all of the known properties of real graphs. Moreover, we present tools for discovering anomalies and patterns in two types of graphs, static and time-evolving. For the former, we present the 'CenterPiece' subgraphs (CePS), which expects q query nodes (eg., suspicious and finds the node that is best connected to all q of them (eg., the master mind of a criminal group). We also show how to compute CenterPiece subgraphs efficiently. For the time evolving graphs, we present tensor-based methods, and apply them on real data, like the DBLP author-paper dataset, where they are able to find natural research communities, and track their evolution. Finally, we also briefly mention some results on influence and virus propagation on real graphs, as well as on the emerging map/reduce approach and its impact on large graph mining.

    :abstractText: "We propose a method to achieve declustering for cartesian product files on M units. The focus is on range queries, as opposed to partial match queries that older declustering methods have examined. Our method uses a distance-preserving mapping, namely, the Hilbert curve, to impose a linear ordering on the multidimensional points (buckets); then, it traverses the buckets according to this ordering, assigning buckets to disks in a round-robin fashion. Thanks to the good distance-preserving properties of the Hilbert curve, the end result is that each disk contains buckets that are far away in the K-d address space. This is exactly the goal of declustering. Experiments show that these intuitive arguments lead indeed to good performance: the proposed method performs at least as well or better than older declustering schemes."

    :abstractText: Environmental variations cause significant fluctuations in WiFi signals in the same location over time, rendering traditional RF-to-location pre-trained maps quickly obsolete. To solve this problem, we use a two-phase approach to determining the user's location. The first phase utilizes traditional patternmatching to identify the general location, and a second phase applies logistic regression to distinguish between finer-grained locations. An adaptive calibration system allows the user to re-train and dynamically update the signal strength maps to account for the fluctuated signals. We show that our two-phase approach is able to achieve generally high accuracy (95%) and over in areas of high signal fluctuations due to heavy access point and human density.

    :abstractText: "Data stream values are often associated with multiple aspects. For example each value observed at a given time-stamp from environmental sensors may have an associated type (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) as well as location. Time-stamp, type and location are the three aspects, which can be modeled using a tensor (high-order array). However, the time aspect is special, with a natural ordering, and with successive time-ticks having usually correlated values. Standard multiway analysis ignores this structure. To capture it, we propose 2 Heads Tensor Analysis (2-heads), which provides a qualitatively different treatment on time. Unlike most existing approaches that use a PCA-like summarization scheme for all aspects, 2-heads treats the time aspect carefully. 2-heads combines the power of classic multilinear analysis with wavelets, leading to a powerful mining tool. Furthermore, 2-heads has several other advantages as well: (a) it can be computed incrementally in a streaming fashion, (b) it has a provable error guarantee and, (c) it achieves significant compression ratio against competitors. Finally, we show experiments on real datasets, and we illustrate how 2-heads reveals interesting trends in the data. This is an extended abstract of an article published in the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal."

    :abstractText: Given a large bipartite graph (like document-term, or userproduct graph), how can we find meaningful communities, quickly, and automatically? We propose to look for community hierarchies, with communities- within-communities. Our proposed method, the Context-specific Cluster Tree (CCT) finds such communities at multiple levels, with no user intervention, based on information theoretic principles (MDL). More specifically, it partitions the graph into progressively more refined subgraphs, allowing users to quickly navigate from the global, coarse structure of a graph to more focused and local patterns. As a fringe benefit, and also as an additional indication of its quality, it also achieves better compression than typical, non-hierarchical methods. We demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness on real, large graphs.

    :abstractText: "We propose the concept of fractal dimension of a set of points, in order to quantify the deviation from the uniformity distribution. Using measurements on real data sets (road intersections of U.S. counties, star coordinates from NASA's Infrared-Ultraviolet Explorer etc.) we provide evidence that real data indeed are skewed, and, moreover, we show that they behave as mathematical fractals, with a measurable, non-integer fractal dimension.Armed with this tool, we then show its practical use in predicting the performance of spatial access methods, and specifically of the R-trees. We provide the first analysis of R-trees for skewed distributions of points: We develop a formula that estimates the number of disk accesses for range queries, given only the fractal dimension of the point set, and its count. Experiments on real data sets show that the formula is very accurate: the relative error is usually below 5%, and it rarely exceeds 10%.We believe that the fractal dimension will help replace the uniformity and independence assumptions, allowing more accurate analysis for any spatial access method, as well as better estimates for query optimization on multi-attribute queries."

    :abstractText: The problem examined is to distribute a binary Cartesian product file on multiple disks to maximize the parallelism for partial match queries. Cartesian product files appear as a result of some secondary key access methods, such as the multiattribute hashing [10], the grid file [6] etc.. For the binary case, the problem is reduced into grouping the 2n binary strings on n bits in m groups of unsimilar strings. The main idea proposed in this paper is to group the strings such that the group forms an Error Correcting Code (ECC). This construction guarantees that the strings of a given group will have large Hamming distances, i.e., they will differ in many bit positions. Intuitively, this should result into good declustering. We briefly mention previous heuristics for declustering, we describe how exactly to build a declustering scheme using an ECC, and we prove a theorem that gives a necessary condition for our method to be optimal. Analytical results show that our method is superior to older heuristics, and that it is very close to the theoretical (non-tight) bound.

    :abstractText: In this paper we propose the use of fractals and especially the Hilbert curve, in order to design good distance-preserving mappings. Such mappings improve the performance of secondary-key- and spatial- access methods, where multi-dimensional points have to be stored on an 1-dimensional medium (e.g., disk). Good clustering reduces the number of disk accesses on retrieval, improving the response time. Our experiments on range queries and nearest neighbor queries showed that the proposed Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than older methods (&ldquo;bit-shuffling&rdquo;, or Peano curve), for every situation we tried.

    :abstractText: Time-series data naturally arise in countless domains, such as meteorology, astrophysics, geology, multimedia, and economics. Similarity search is very popular, and DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) is one of the two prevailing distance measures. Although DTW incurs a heavy computation cost, it provides scaling along the time axis. In this paper, we propose FTW (Fast search method for dynamic Time Warping), which guarantees no false dismissals in similarity query processing. FTW efficiently prunes a significant number of the search cost. Experiments on real and synthetic sequence data sets reveals that FTW is significantly faster than the best existing method, up to 222 times.

    :abstractText: Data streams are fundamental in several data processing applications involving large amount of data generated continuously as a sequence of events. Frequently, such events are not stored, so the data is analyzed and queried as they arrive and discarded right away. In many applications these events are represented by a predetermined number of numerical attributes. Thus, without loss of generality, we can consider events as elements from a dimensional domain. A sequence of events in a data stream can be characterized by its intrinsic dimension, which in dimensional datasets is usually lower than the embedding dimensionality. As the intrinsic dimension can be used to improve the performance of algorithms handling dimensional data (specially query optimization) measuring it is relevant to improve data streams processing and analysis as well. Moreover, it can also be useful to forecast data behavior. Hence, we present an algorithm able to measure the intrinsic dimension of a data stream on the fly, following its continuously changing behavior. We also present experimental studies, using both real and synthetic data streams, showing that the results on well-understood datasets closely follow what is expected from the known behavior of the data.

    :abstractText: "What patterns can we find in a bursty web traffic? On the web or on the internet graph itself? How about the distributions of galaxies in the sky, or the distribution of a company's customers in geographical space? How long should we expect a nearest-neighbor search to take, when there are 100 attributes per patient or customer record? The traditional assumptions (uniformity, independence, Poisson arrivals, Gaussian distributions), often fail miserably. Should we give up trying to find patterns in such settings? Self-similarity, fractals and power laws are extremely successful in describing real datasets (coast-lines, rivers basins, stock-prices, brain-surfaces, communication-line noise, to name a few). We show some old and new successes, involving modeling of graph topologies (internet, web and social networks); modeling galaxy and video data; dimensionality reduction; and more.

    :abstractText: Despite the apparent randomness of the Internet, we discover some surprisingly simple power-laws of the Internet topology. These power-laws hold for three snapshots of the Internet, between November 1997 and December 1998, despite a 45% growth of its size during that period. We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree. In addition, these power-laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neighborhood size, and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols. Furthermore, we can use them to generate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes.

    :abstractText: "This work explores the application of a machine learning tool, CART modeling, to storage devices. We have developed approaches to predict a device's performance as a function of input workloads, requiring no knowledge of the device internals. Two uses of CART models are considered: one that predicts per-request response times (and then derives aggregate values) and one that predicts aggregate values directly from workload characteristics. After training on the device in question, both provide reasonably-accurate black box models across a range of test traces from real environments. An expanded version of this paper is available as a technical report [1]."

    :abstractText: Multiattribute hashing and its variations have been proposed for partial match and range queries in the past. The main idea is that each record yields a bitstring @@@@ (&ldquo;record signature&rdquo;), according to the values of its attributes. The binary value (@@@@)2 of this string decides the bucket that the record is stored. In this paper we propose to use Gray codes instead of binary codes, in order to map record signatures to buckets. In Gray codes, successive codewords differ in the value of exactly one bit position, thus, successive buckets hold records with similar record signatures. The proposed method achieves better clustering of similar records and avoids some of the (expensive) random disk accesses, replacing them with sequential ones. We develop a mathematical model, derive formulas giving the average performance of both methods and show that the proposed method achieves 0% - 50% relative savings over the binary codes. We also discuss how Gray codes could be applied to some retrieval methods designed for range queries, such as the grid file [Nievergelt84a] and the approach based on the so-called z-ordering [Orenstein84a].

    :abstractText: "A very promising idea for fast searching in traditional and multimedia databases is to map objects into points in k-d space, using k feature-extraction functions, provided by a domain expert [25]. Thus, we can subsequently use highly fine-tuned spatial access methods (SAMs), to answer several types of queries, including the 'Query By Example' type (which translates to a range query); the 'all pairs' query (which translates to a spatial join [8]); the nearest-neighbor or best-match query, etc.However, designing feature extraction functions can be hard. It is relatively easier for a domain expert to assess the similarity/distance of two objects. Given only the distance information though, it is not obvious how to map objects into points.This is exactly the topic of this paper. We describe a fast algorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarities are preserved. There are two benefits from this mapping: (a) efficient retrieval, in conjunction with a SAM, as discussed before and (b) visualization and data-mining: the objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing potential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining is looking for.We introduce an older method from pattern recognition, namely, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [51]; although unsuitable for indexing, we use it as yardstick for our method. Then, we propose a much faster algorithm to solve the problem in hand, while in addition it allows for indexing. Experiments on real and synthetic data indeed show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than MDS, (being linear, as opposed to quadratic, on the database size N), while it manages to preserve distances and the overall structure of the data-set."

    :abstractText: "We present an efficient indexing method to locate 1-dimensional subsequences within a collection of sequences, such that the subsequences match a given (query) pattern within a specified tolerance. The idea is to map each data sequences into a small set of multidimensional rectangles in feature space. Then, these rectangles can be readily indexed using traditional spatial access methods, like the R*-tree [9]. In more detail, we use a sliding window over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space. We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails, which are subsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We also examine queries of varying lengths, and we show how to handle each case efficiently. We implemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock price movements). We compared the method to sequential scanning, which is the only obvious competitor. The results were excellent: our method accelerated the search time from 3 times up to 100 times."

    :abstractText: This paper provides an analysis of R-trees and a variation (R+-trees) that avoids overlapping rectangles in intermediate nodes of the tree. The main contributions of the paper are the following. We provide the first known analysis of R-trees. Although formulas are given for objects in one dimension (line segments), they can be generalized for objects in higher dimensions as well. We show how the transformation of objects to higher dimensions [HINR83] can be effectively used as a tool for the analysis of R- and R+- trees. Finally, we derive formulas for R+-trees and compare the two methods analytically. The results we obtained show that R+-trees require less than half the disk accesses required by a corresponding R-tree when searching files of real life sizes R+-trees are clearly superior in cases where there are few long segments and a lot of small ones.

    :abstractText: We discovered a surprising law governing the spatial join selectivity across two sets of points. An example of such a spatial join is &ldquo;find the libraries that are within 10 miles of schools&rdquo;. Our law dictates that the number of such qualifying pairs follows a power law, whose exponent we call &ldquo;pair-count exponent&rdquo; (PC). We show that this law also holds for self-spatial-joins (&ldquo;find schools within 5 miles of other schools&rdquo;) in addition to the general case that the two point-sets are distinct. Our law holds for many real datasets, including diverse environments (geographic datasets, feature vectors from biology data, galaxy data from astronomy). In addition, we introduce the concept of the Box-Occupancy-Product-Sum (BOPS) plot, and we show that it can compute the pair-count exponent in a timely manner, reducing the run time by orders of magnitude, from quadratic to linear. Due to the pair-count exponent and our analysis (Law 1), we can achieve accurate selectivity estimates in constant time (O(1)) without the need for sampling or other expensive operations. The relative error in selectivity is about 30% with our fast BOPS method, and even better (about 10%), if we use the slower, quadratic method.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of exploiting parallelism to accelerate the performance of spacial access methods and specifically, R-trees [11]. Our goal is to design a server for spatial data, so that to maximize the throughput of range queries. This can be achieved by (a) maximizing parallelism for large range queries, and (b) by engaging as few disks as possible on point queries [22]. We propose a simple hardware architecture consisting of one processor with several disks attached to it. On this architecture, we propose to distribute the nodes of a traditonal R-tree, with cross-disk pointers (&ldquo;Multiplexed&rdquo; R-tree). The R-tree code is identical to the one for a single-disk R-tree, with the only addition that we have to decide which disk a newly created R-tree node should be stored in. We propose and examine several criteria to choose a disk for a new node. The most successful one, termed &ldquo;proximity index&rdquo; or PI, estimates the similarity of the new node with the other R-tree nodes already on a disk, and chooses the disk with the lowest similarity. Experimental results show that our scheme consistently outperforms all the other heuristics for node-to-disk assignments, achieving up to 55% gains over the Round Robin one. Experiments also indicate that the multiplexed R-tree with PI heuristic gives better response time than the disk-stripping (=&ldquo;Super-node&rdquo;) approach, and imposes lighter load on the I/O sub-system. The speed up of our method is close to linear speed up, increasing with the size of the queries.

    :abstractText: Ad hoc querying is difficult on very large datasets, since it is usually not possible to have the entire dataset on disk. While compression can be used to decrease the size of the dataset, compressed data is notoriously difficult to index or access. In this paper we consider a very large dataset comprising multiple distinct time sequences. Each point in the sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress such a dataset into a format that supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the data is uncompressed. Experiments on large, real world datasets (AT&T customer calling patterns) show that the proposed method achieves an average of less than 5% error in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5% of the original space (i.e., a 40:1 compression ratio), with these numbers not very sensitive to dataset size. Experiments on aggregate queries achieved a 0.5% reconstruction error with a space requirement under 2%.

    :abstractText: Data mining in large data sets often requires a sampling or summarization step to form an in-core representation of the data that can be processed more efficiently. Uniform random sampling is frequently used in practice and also frequently criticized because it will miss small clusters. Many natural phenomena are known to follow Zipf's distribution and the inability of uniform sampling to find small clusters is of practical concern. Density Biased Sampling is proposed to probabilistically under-sample dense regions and over-sample light regions. A weighted sample is used to preserve the densities of the original data. Density biased sampling naturally includes uniform sampling as a special case. A memory efficient algorithm is proposed that approximates density biased sampling using only a single scan of the data. We empirically evaluate density biased sampling using synthetic data sets that exhibit varying cluster size distributions finding up to a factor of six improvement over uniform sampling.

    :abstractText: "This paper proposes a scheme for scheduling disk requests that takes advantage of the ability of high-level functions to operate directly at individual disk drives. We show that such a scheme makes it possible to support a Data Mining workload on an OLTP system almost for free: there is only a small impact on the throughput and response time of the existing workload. Specifically, we show that an OLTP system has the disk resources to consistently provide one third of its sequential bandwidth to a background Data Mining task with close to zero impact on OLTP throughput and response time at high transaction loads. At low transaction loads, we show much lower impact than observed in previous work. This means that a production OLTP system can be used for Data Mining tasks without the expense of a second dedicated system. Our scheme takes advantage of close interaction with the on-disk scheduler by reading blocks for the Data Mining workload as the disk head &ldquo;passes over&rdquo; them while satisfying demand blocks from the OLTP request stream. We show that this scheme provides a consistent level of throughput for the background workload even at very high foreground loads. Such a scheme is of most benefit in combination with an Active Disk environment that allows the background Data Mining application to also take advantage of the processing power and memory available directly on the disk drives."

    :abstractText: "The goal is to monitor multiple numerical streams, and determine which pairs are correlated with lags, as well as the value of each such lag. Lag correlations (and anti-correlations) are frequent, and very interesting in practice: For example, a decrease in interest rates typically precedes an increase in house sales by a few months; higher amounts of fluoride in the drinking water may lead to fewer dental cavities, some years later. Additional settings include network analysis, sensor monitoring, financial data analysis, and moving object tracking. Such data streams are often correlated (or anti-correlated), but with an unknown lag.We propose BRAID, a method to detect lag correlations between data streams. BRAID can handle data streams of semi-infinite length, incrementally, quickly, and with small resource consumption. We also provide a theoretical analysis, which, based on Nyquist's sampling theorem, shows that BRAID can estimate lag correlations with little, and often with no error at all. Our experiments on real and realistic data show that BRAID detects the correct lag perfectly most of the time (the largest relative error was about 1%); while it is up to 40,000 times faster than the naive implementation."

    :abstractText: Existing methods for peediction spatio-temporal databases assume that objects move according to linear functions. This severely limits their applicability, since in practice movement is more complex, and individual objects may follow drastically diffferent motion patterns. In order to overcome these problems, we first introduce a general framework for monitoring and indexing moving objects, where (i) each boject computes individually the function that accurately captures its movement and (ii) a server indexes the object locations at a coarse level and processes queries using a filter-refinement mechanism. Our second contribution is a novel recursive motion function that supports a broad class of non-linear motion patterns. The function does not presume any a-priori movement but can postulate the particular motion of each object by examining its locations at recent timestamps. Finally. we propse an efficient indexing scheme that faciliates the processing of predicitive queries without false misses.

    :abstractText: How can we efficiently find a clustering, i.e. a concise description of the cluster structure, of a given data set which contains an unknown number of clusters of different shape and distribution and is contaminated by noise? Most existing clustering methods are restricted to the Gaussian cluster model and are very sensitive to noise. If the cluster content follows a non-Gaussian distribution and/or the data set contains a few outliers belonging to no cluster, then the computed data distribution does not match well the true data distribution, or an unnaturally high number of clusters is required to represent the true data distribution of the data set. In this paper we propose OCI (Outlier-robust Clustering using Independent Components), a clustering method which overcomes these problems by (1) applying the exponential power distribution (EPD) as cluster model which is a generalization of Gaussian, uniform, Laplacian and many other distribution functions, (2) applying the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for both determining the main directions inside a cluster as well as finding split planes in a top-down clustering approach, and (3) defining an efficient and effective filter for outliers, based on EPD and ICA. Our method is parameter-free and as a top-down clustering approach very efficient. An extensive experimental evaluation shows both the accuracy of the obtained clustering result as well as the efficiency of our method.

    :abstractText: This paper proposes novel and effective techniques to estimate a radius to answer k-nearest neighbor queries. The first technique targets datasets where it is possible to learn the distribution about the pairwise distances between the elements, generating a global estimation that applies to the whole dataset. The second technique targets datasets where the first technique cannot be employed, generating estimations that depend on where the query center is located. The proposed k-NNF() algorithm combines both techniques, achieving remarkable speedups. Experiments performed on both real and synthetic datasets have shown that the proposed algorithm can accelerate k-NN queries more than 26 times compared with the incremental algorithm and spends half of the total time compared with the traditional k-NN() algorithms.

    :abstractText: We introduce an auditing framework for determining whether a database system is adhering to its data disclosure policies. Users formulate audit expressions to specify the (sensitive) data subject to disclosure review. An audit component accepts audit expressions and returns all queries (deemed "suspicious") that accessed the specified data during their execution. The overhead of our approach on query processing is small, involving primarily the logging of each query string along with other minor annotations. Database triggers are used to capture updates in a backlog database. At the time of audit, a static analysis phase selects a subset of logged queries for further analysis. These queries are combined and transformed into an SQL audit query, which when run against the backlog database, identifies the suspicious queries efficiently and precisely. We describe the algorithms and data structures used in a DB2-based implementation of this framework. Experimental results reinforce our design choices and show the practicality of the approach.

According to this method, the documents (or records) are stored sequentially in the \"text file\". Abstractions (\"signatures\") of the documents (or records) are stored in the \"signature file\". The latter serves as a filter on retrieval: It helps discarding a large number of nonqualifying documents. We pro-pose a signature extraction method that takes into account the query and occurrence frequencies, thus achieving better performance. The model we present is general enough, so that results can be applied not only for text retrieval but also for files with formatted data."

    :abstractText: InteMon is a prototype monitoring and mining system for large clusters. Currently, it monitors over 100 hosts of a prototype data center at CMU. It uses the SNMP protocol and it stores the monitoring data in an mySQL database. Then, it allows for visualization of the time-series data using a JSP web-based frontend interface for users.What sets it apart from other cluster monitoring systems is its ability to automatically analyze the monitoring data in real time and alert the users for potential anomalies. It uses state of the art stream mining methods, it has a sophisticated definition of anomalies (broken correlations among input streams), and it can also pinpoint the reason of the anomaly. InteMon has a user-friendly GUI, it allows the users to perform interactive mining tasks, and it is fully operational.

    :abstractText: "Sensor devices and embedded processors are becoming ubiquitous. Their limited resources (CPU, memory and/or communication bandwidth and power) pose some interesting challenges. We need both powerful and concise \"languages\" to represent the important features of the data, which can (a) adapt and handle arbitrary periodic components, including bursts, and (b) require little memory and a single pass over the data. We propose AWSOM (Arbitrary Window Stream mOdeling Method), which allows sensors in remote or hostile environments to efficiently and effectively discover interesting patterns and trends. This can be done automatically, i.e., with no user intervention and expert tuning before or during data gathering. Our algorithms require limited resources and can thus be incorporated in sensors, possibly alongside a distributed query processing engine [9, 5, 22]. Updates are performed in constant time, using logarithmic space. Existing, state of the art forecasting methods (SARIMA, GARCH, etc) fall short on one or more of these requirements. To the best of our knowledge, AWSOM is the first method that has all the above characteristics. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that AWSOM discovers meaningful patterns over long time periods. Thus, the patterns can also be used to make long-range forecasts, which are notoriously difficult to perform. In fact, AWSOM outperforms manually set up auto-regressive models, both in terms of long-term pattern detection and modeling, as well as by at least 10\xC3\x97 in resource consumption."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we introduce SPIRIT (Streaming Pattern dIscoveRy in multIple Time-series). Given n numerical data streams, all of whose values we observe at each time tick t, SPIRIT can incrementally find correlations and hidden variables, which summarise the key trends in the entire stream collection. It can do this quickly, with no buffering of stream values and without comparing pairs of streams. Moreover, it is any-time, single pass, and it dynamically detects changes. The discovered trends can also be used to immediately spot potential anomalies, to do efficient forecasting and, more generally, to dramatically simplify further data processing. Our experimental evaluation and case studies show that SPIRIT can incrementally capture correlations and discover trends, efficiently and effectively.

    :abstractText: "Several graph visualization tools exist. However, they are not able to handle large graphs, and/or they do not allow interaction. We are interested on large graphs, with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges: the first one is that any straightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one is sensory overload: even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly, the user would be overwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too cluttered as nodes and edges overlap each other.Our GMine system addresses both these issues, by using summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph exploration by partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storing it into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree. GMine offers summarization by implementing an innovative subgraph extraction algorithm and then visualizing its output."

How about the distributions of galaxies in the sky, or the distribution of a company's customers in geographical space? How long should we expect a nearest-neighbor search to take, when there are 100 attributes per patient or customer record? The traditional assumptions (uniformity, independence, Poisson arrivals, Gaussian distributions), often fail miserably. Should we give up trying to find patterns in such settings? Self-similarity, fractals and power laws are extremely successful in describing real datasets (coast-lines, rivers basins, stock-prices, brain-surfaces, communication-line noise, to name a few). We show some old and new successes, involving modeling of graph topologies (internet, web and social networks); modeling galaxy and video data; dimensionality reduction; and more.

Feature vectors represent the main distribution of data and they are obtained by various data analysis methods. This paper examines three methods: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), clustering, and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). SVD and clustering are popular existing methods. Clustering, especially, is applied to many topic detection methods. ICA was recently developed in signal processing research. In applications related to text data, however, ICA has not been compared with SVD and clustering, nor has its relationship with them been explored. This paper reports comparative experiments for these three methods and then shows properties as they apply to text data."

    :abstractText: Given a huge online social network, how do we retrieve information from it through crawling? Even better, how do we improve the crawling performance by using parallel crawlers that work independently? In this paper, we present the framework of parallel crawlers for online social networks, utilizing a centralized queue. To show how this works in practice, we describe our implementation of the crawlers for an online auction website. The crawlers work independently, therefore the failing of one crawler does not affect the others at all. The framework ensures that no redundant crawling would occur. Using the crawlers that we built, we visited a total of approximately 11 million auction users, about 66,000 of which were completely crawled.

    :abstractText: Given a large online network of online auction users and their histories of transactions, how can we spot anomalies and auction fraud? This paper describes the design and implementation of NetProbe, a system that we propose for solving this problem. NetProbe models auction users and transactions as a Markov Random Field tuned to detect the suspicious patterns that fraudsters create, and employs a Belief Propagation mechanism to detect likely fraudsters. Our experiments show that NetProbe is both efficient and effective for fraud detection. We report experiments on synthetic graphs with as many as 7,000 nodes and 30,000 edges, where NetProbe was able to spot fraudulent nodes with over 90% precision and recall, within a matter of seconds. We also report experiments on a real dataset crawled from eBay, with nearly 700,000 transactions between more than 66,000users, where NetProbe was highly effective at unearthing hidden networks of fraudsters, within a realistic response time of about 6 minutes. For scenarios where the underlying data is dynamic in nature, we propose IncrementalNetProbe, which is an approximate, but fast, variant of NetProbe. Our experiments prove that Incremental NetProbe executes nearly doubly fast as compared to NetProbe, while retaining over 99% of its accuracy.

    :abstractText: Given a terabyte click log, can we build an efficient and effective click model? It is commonly believed that web search click logs are a gold mine for search business, because they reflect users' preference over web documents presented by the search engine. Click models provide a principled approach to inferring user-perceived relevance of web documents, which can be leveraged in numerous applications in search businesses. Due to the huge volume of click data, scalability is a must. We present the click chain model (CCM), which is based on a solid, Bayesian framework. It is both scalable and incremental, perfectly meeting the computational challenges imposed by the voluminous click logs that constantly grow. We conduct an extensive experimental study on a data set containing 8.8 million query sessions obtained in July 2008 from a commercial search engine. CCM consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art competitors in a number of metrics, with over 9.7% better log-likelihood, over 6.2% better click perplexity and much more robust (up to 30%) prediction of the first and the last clicked position.

    :abstractText: Modern data centers have a large number of components that must be monitored, including servers, switches/routers, and environmental control systems. This paper describes InteMon, a prototype monitoring and mining system for data centers. It uses the SNMP protocol to monitor a new data center at Carnegie Mellon. It stores the monitoring data in a MySQL database, allowing visualization of the time-series data using a JSP web-based frontend interface for system administrators. What sets InteMon apart from other cluster monitoring systems is its ability to automatically analyze correlations in the monitoring data in real time and alert administrators of potential anomalies. It uses efficient, state of the art stream mining methods to report broken correlations among input streams. It also uses these methods to intelligently compress historical data and avoid the need for administrators to configure threshold-based monitoring bands.

    :abstractText: Active disk systems leverage the aggregate processing power of net-worked disks to offer increased processing throughput for large-scale data mining tasks. As processor performance increases and memory cost decreases, system intelligence continues to move away from the CPU and into peripherals. The authors propose using an active disk storage device that combines on-drive processing and memory with software downloadability to allow disks to execute application-level functions directly at the device.With active disks, application-specific functions access the excess computation power in drives. Active disks combine the requisite processing power of general-purpose disk-drive microprocessors with the special-purpose functionality of end-user programmability.The authors' experiment showed that active disks can accelerate an existing database system by moving data-intensive processing to the disks, thereby reducing the server CPU's processing load. The active disk approach eliminates the need for the PC processor, its memory subsystem, and I/O backplane, which makes active disks relatively inexpensive. The development of new data-intensive algorithms requires large amounts of disk space and high data-transfer rates for various processing tasks, with richer database structures, new content, new data sources, and novel applications for collected data. The authors contend that active disks can meet these needs while offering the parallelism available in large storage systems.

    :abstractText: "How does the Web look? How could we tell an abnormal social network from a normal one? These and similar questions are important in many fields where the data can intuitively be cast as a graph; examples range from computer networks to sociology to biology and many more. Indeed, any M : N relation in database terminology can be represented as a graph. A lot of these questions boil down to the following: &ldquo;How can we generate synthetic but realistic graphs?&rdquo; To answer this, we must first understand what patterns are common in real-world graphs and can thus be considered a mark of normality/realism. This survey give an overview of the incredible variety of work that has been done on these problems. One of our main contributions is the integration of points of view from physics, mathematics, sociology, and computer science. Further, we briefly describe recent advances on some related and interesting graph problems."

    :abstractText: This paper compares text retrieval methods intended for office systems. The operational requirements of the office environment are discussed, and retrieval methods from database systems and from information retrieval systems are examined. We classify these methods and examine the most interesting representatives of each class. Attempts to speed up retrieval with special purpose hardware are also presented, and issues such as approximate string matching and compression are discussed. A qualitative comparison of the examined methods is presented. The signature file method is discussed in more detail.

    :abstractText: Will we ever have a theory of data mining analogous to the relational algebra in databases? Why do we have so many clearly different clustering algorithms? Could data mining be automated? We show that the answer to all these questions is negative, because data mining is closely related to compression and Kolmogorov complexity; and the latter is undecidable. Therefore, data mining will always be an art, where our goal will be to find better models (patterns) that fit our datasets as best as possible.

    :abstractText: The problem of identifying meaningful patterns in a database lies at the very heart of data mining. A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attribute correlations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications --- since rules would fail in the absence of pattern --- but also the identification of groups of mutually correlated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes, from which existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper, we describe a scalable, effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes, and is not restricted to a specific family of mapping functions, such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of the algorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets, and demonstrate that it is able to spot the correlated attributes. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed technique is linear on the number of elements and of correlations in the dataset.

    :abstractText: "Data stream values are often associated with multiple aspects. For example, each value observed at a given time-stamp from environmental sensors may have an associated type (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc) as well as location. Time-stamp, type and location are the three aspects, which can be modeled using a tensor (high-order array). However, the time aspect is special, with a natural ordering, and with successive time-ticks having usually correlated values. Standard multiway analysis ignores this structure. To capture it, we propose 2 Heads Tensor Analysis (2-heads), which provides a qualitatively different treatment on time. Unlike most existing approaches that use a PCA-like summarization scheme for all aspects, 2-heads treats the time aspect carefully. 2-heads combines the power of classic multilinear analysis (PARAFAC [1], Tucker [5], DTA/STA [3], WTA [2]) with wavelets, leading to a powerful mining tool. Furthermore, 2-heads has several other advantages as well: (a) it can be computed incrementally in a streaming fashion, (b) it has a provable error guarantee and, (c) it achieves significant compression ratio against competitors. Finally, we show experiments on real datasets, and we illustrate how 2-heads reveals interesting trends in the data.This is an extended abstract of an article published in the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal [4]."

    :abstractText: "Existing estimation approaches for spatial databases often rely on the assumption that data distribution in a small region is uniform, which seldom holds in practice. Moreover, their applicability is limited to specific estimation tasks under certain distance metric. This paper develops the Power-method, a comprehensive technique applicable to a wide range of query optimization problems under both L\xC2\xBF and L2 metrics. The Power-method eliminates the local uniformity assumption and is, therefore, accurate even for datasets where existing approaches fail. Furthermore, it performs estimation by evaluating only one simple formula with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments confirm that the Power-method outperforms previous techniques in terms of accuracy and applicability to various optimization scenarios."

    :abstractText: "What does a ''normal'' computer (or social) network look like? How can we spot ''abnormal'' sub-networks in the Internet, or web graph? The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (''how will a computer virus spread?''). The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such patterns and ''laws'', including the ''min-cut plots'' discovered by us. This is the first part of our NetMine package: given any large graph, it provides visual feedback about these patterns; any significant deviations from the expected patterns can thus be immediately flagged by the user as abnormalities in the graph. The second part of NetMine is the A-plots tool for visualizing the adjacency matrix of the graph in innovative new ways, again to find outliers. Third, NetMine contains the R-MAT (Recursive MATrix) graph generator, which can successfully model many of the patterns found in real-world graphs and quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters. We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show the effectiveness of our approach."

Algorithms to estimate the fractal dimension exist, such as the straightforward quadratic algorithm and the faster O(N log N) or even O(N) box-counting algorithms. However, the sub-quadratic algorithms require \xCE\xA9(N) space. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that computes the fractal dimension in a single pass, using a constant amount of memory relative to data cardinality. Experimental results on synthetic and real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm."

    :abstractText: "How closely related are two nodes in a graph? How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the &#x201c;connection subgraphs&#x201d;, personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block-wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman&#x2013;Morrison lemma for matrix inversion. Experimental results on the Corel image and the DBLP dabasets demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant savings over the straightforward implementations: they can save several orders of magnitude in pre-computation and storage cost, and they achieve up to 150&#x00a0;&#x00d7; speed up with 90%+ quality preservation."

    :abstractText: Robotic tape libraries are popular for applications with very high storage requirements, such as video servers. Here, we study the throughput of a tape library system, we design a new scheduling algorithm, the so-called Relief, and compare it against some older/straightforward ones, like FCFS, Maximum Queue Length (MQL) and an unfair one (Bypass), roughly equivalent to Shortest Job First. The proposed algorithm incorporates an aging mechanism in order to attain fairness and we prove that, under certain assumptions, it minimizes the average start-up latency. Extensive simulation experiments show that Relief outperforms its competitors (fair and unfair alike), with up to 203% improvement in throughput, for the same rejection ratio.

    :abstractText: Traffic data, such as disk and memory accesses, typically exhibits burstiness, temporal locality, and spatial locality. However, except for qualitative speculations, it is not even known how to measure the spatio-temporal correlation, let alone how to re-produce it realistically. In this paper, we propose the "entropy plots" to quantify the correlation and develop a new statistical model, the "PQRS" model, to capture the burstiness and correlation of the real spatio-temporal traffic. Moreover, the model requires very few parameters and offers linear scalability. Experiments with multiple real data sets show that our model can mimic real traces very well.

We introduce two operations on bipartite graphs: 1) identifying similar nodes (relevance search), and 2) finding nodes connecting irrelevant nodes (anomaly detection). And we propose algorithms to compute the relevance score for each node using random walk with restarts and graph partitioning; we also propose algorithms to identify anomalies, using relevance scores. We evaluate the quality of relevance search based on semantics of the datasets, and we also measure the performance of the anomaly detection algorithm with manually injected anomalies. Both effectiveness and efficiency of the methods are confirmed by experiments on several real datasets."

    :abstractText: Finding patterns in large, real, spatio/temporal data continues to attract high interest (e.g., sales of products over space and time, patterns in mobile phone users; sensor networks collecting operational data from automobiles, or even from humans with wearable computers). In this paper, we describe an interdisciplinary research effort to couple knowledge discovery in large environmental databases with biological and chemical sensor networks, in order to revolutionize drinking water quality and security decision making. We describe a distribution and operation protocol for the placement and utilization of in situ environmental sensors by combining (1) new algorithms for spatialtemporal data mining, (2) new methods to model water quality and security dynamics, and (3) a sophisticated decision-analysis framework. The project was recently funded by NSF and represents application of these research areas to the critical current issue of ensuring safe and secure drinking water to the population of the United States.

This paper describes InteMon, a prototype monitoring and mining system for data centers. It uses the SNMP protocol to monitor a new data center at Carnegie Mellon. It stores the monitoring data in a MySQL database, allowing visualization of the time-series data using a JSP web-based frontend interface for system administrators. What sets InteMon apart from other cluster monitoring systems is its ability to automatically analyze correlations in the monitoring data in real time and alert administrators of potential anomalies. It uses efficient, state of the art stream mining methods to report broken correlations among input streams. It also uses these methods to intelligently compress historical data and avoid the need for administrators to configure threshold-based monitoring bands.

    :abstractText: The problem of declustering, that is, how to distribute a binary Cartesian product file on multiple disks to maximize the parallelism for partial match queries, is examined. Cartesian product files appear as a result of some secondary key access methods. For the binary case, the problem is reduced to grouping the 2/sup n/ binary strings on n bits in m groups of unsimilar strings. It is proposed that the strings be grouped such that these group forms an error correcting code (ECC). This construction guarantees that the strings of a given group will have large Hamming distances, i.e., they will differ in many bit positions. Intuitively, this should result in good declustering. The authors describe how to build a declustering scheme using an ECC, and prove a theorem that gives a necessary condition for the proposed method to be optimal. Analytical results show that the proposed method is superior to older heuristics, and that it is very close to the theoretical (nontight) bound.

    :abstractText: "How will a virus propagate in a real network&quest; How long does it take to disinfect a network given particular values of infection rate and virus death rate&quest; What is the single best node to immunize&quest; Answering these questions is essential for devising network-wide strategies to counter viruses. In addition, viral propagation is very similar in principle to the spread of rumors, information, and &ldquo;fads,&rdquo; implying that the solutions for viral propagation would also offer insights into these other problem settings. We answer these questions by developing a nonlinear dynamical system (NLDS) that accurately models viral propagation in any arbitrary network, including real and synthesized network graphs. We propose a general epidemic threshold condition for the NLDS system: we prove that the epidemic threshold for a network is exactly the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Finally, we show that below the epidemic threshold, infections die out at an exponential rate. Our epidemic threshold model subsumes many known thresholds for special-case graphs (e.g., Erd&ouml;s--R&eacute;nyi, BA powerlaw, homogeneous). We demonstrate the predictive power of our model with extensive experiments on real and synthesized graphs, and show that our threshold condition holds for arbitrary graphs. Finally, we show how to utilize our threshold condition for practical uses: It can dictate which nodes to immunize; it can assess the effects of a throttling policy; it can help us design network topologies so that they are more resistant to viruses."

    :abstractText: We give a closed-form expression for the average number of n-dimensional quadtree nodes ("pieces" or "blocks") required by an n-dimensional hyperrectangle aligned with the axes. Our formula includes as special cases the formulae of previous efforts for two-dimensional spaces [8]. It also agrees with theoretical and empirical results that the number of blocks depends on the hypersurface of the hyperrectangle and not on its hypervolume. The practical use of the derived formula is that it allows the estimation of the space requirements of the n-dimensional quadtree decomposition. Quadtrees are used extensively in two-dimensional spaces (geographic information systems and spatial databases in general), as well in higher dimensionality spaces (as oct-trees for three-dimensional spaces, e.g., in graphics, robotics, and three-dimensional medical images [2]). Our formula permits the estimation of the space requirements for data hyperrectangles when stored in an index structure like a (n-dimensional) quadtree, as well as the estimation of the search time for query hyperrectangles, for the so-called linear quadtrees [17]. A theoretical contribution of the paper is the observation that the number of blocks is a piece-wise linear function of the sides of the hyperrectangle.

    :abstractText: "Spatial queries in high-dimensional spaces have been studied extensively recently. Among them, nearest-neighbor queries are important in many settings, including spatial databases (Find the $k$ closest cities) and multimedia databases (Find the $k$ most similar images). Previous analyses have concluded that nearest-neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions due to the notorious \xC2\xBFcurse of dimensionality.\xC2\xBF Here, we show that this may be overpessimistic. We show that what determines the search performance (at least for R-tree-like structures) is the intrinsic dimensionality of the data set and not the dimensionality of the address space (referred to as the embedding dimensionality). The typical (and often implicit) assumption in many previous studies is that the data is uniformly distributed, with independence between attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and exhibit intrinsic (\xC2\xBFfractal\xC2\xBF) dimensionalities that are much lower than their embedding dimension, e.g., due to subtle dependencies between attributes. In this paper, we show how the Hausdorff and Correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield extremely accurate formulas that can predict the I/O performance to within one standard deviation on multiple real and synthetic data sets. The practical contributions of this work are our accurate formulas, which can be used for query optimization in spatial and multimedia databases. The major theoretical contribution is the \xC2\xBFdeflation\xC2\xBF of the dimensionality curse: Our formulas and our experiments show that previous worst-case analyses of nearest-neighbor search in high dimensions are overpessimistic to the point of being unrealistic. The performance depends critically on the intrinsic (\xC2\xBFfractal\xC2\xBF) dimensionality as opposed to the embedding dimension that the uniformity and independence assumptions incorrectly imply."

    :abstractText: We investigate the problem of retrieving similar shapes from a large database; in particular, we focus on medical tumor shapes ("Find tumors that are similar to a given pattern."). We use a natural similarity function for shape-matching, based on concepts from mathematical morphology, and we show how it can be lower-bounded by a set of shape features for safely pruning candidates, thus giving fast and correct output. These features can be organized in a spatial access method, leading to fast indexing for range queries and nearest-neighbor queries. In addition to the lower-bounding, our second contribution is the design of a fast algorithm for nearest-neighbor search, achieving significant speedup while provably guaranteeing correctness. Our experiments demonstrate that roughly 90 percent of the candidates can be pruned using these techniques, resulting in up to 27 times better performance compared to sequential scan.

    :abstractText: By supporting the valid and transaction time dimensions, bitemporal databases represent reality more accurately than conventional databases. In this paper, we examine the issues involved in designing efficient access methods for bitemporal databases, and propose the partial-persistence and the double-tree methodologies. The partial-persistence methodology reduces bitemporal queries to partial persistence problems for which an efficient access method is then designed. The double-tree methodology "sees" each bitemporal data object as consisting of two intervals (a valid-time and a transaction-time interval) and divides objects into two categories according to whether the right endpoint of the transaction time interval is already known. A common characteristic of both methodologies is that they take into account the properties of each time dimension. Their performance is compared with a straightforward approach that "sees" the intervals associated with a bitemporal object as composing one rectangle, which is stored in a single multidimensional access method. Given that some limited additional space is available, our experimental results show that the partial-persistence methodology provides the best overall performance, especially for transaction timeslice queries. For those applications that require ready, off-the-shelf, access methods, the double-tree methodology is a good alternative.

    :abstractText: A superimposed coding method, frame-sliced signature file, is proposed, and the performance of this method is studied and compared with that of other signature file methods. The response time of the method is improved due to its ability to effectively partition the signature file so that fewer random disk accesses are required on both retrieval and insertion, while the good characteristics of conventional square file, i.e., low space overhead, low maintenance cost, and the write-once property, are retained. The generalized version of the method is shown to be a unified framework for several popular signature file methods including the sequential signature file (SSF) method, bit-sliced signature file (BSSF) method, and its enhanced version of B'SSF. A prototype system was implemented on UNIX workstations with the C language. Experimental results on a 2.8-Mb database consisting of 2800 technical reports and a 28-Mb database with 28000 technical reports are presented.

    :abstractText: Several schemes for the linear mapping of a multidimensional space have been proposed for various applications, such as access methods for spatio-temporal databases and image compression. In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering [1], [14]. In this paper, we analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work [14]. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of the query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given in this paper provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and, hence, the total access time.

    :abstractText: We propose a method to handle approximate searching by image content in medical image databases. Image content is represented by attributed relational graphs holding features of objects and relationships between objects. The method relies on the assumption that a fixed number of "labeled" or "expected" objects (e.g., "heart," "lungs," etc.) are common in all images of a given application domain in addition to a variable number of "unexpected" or "unlabeled" objects (e.g., "tumor," "hematoma," etc.). The method can answer queries by example, such as "find all X-rays that are similar to Smith's X-ray." The stored images are mapped to points in a multidimensional space and are indexed using state-of-the-art database methods (R-trees). The proposed method has several desirable properties:Database search is approximate, so that all images up to a prespecified degree of similarity (tolerance) are retrieved.It has no "false dismissals" (i.e., all images qualifying query selection criteria are retrieved).It is much faster than sequential scanning for searching in the main memory and on the disk (i.e., by up to an order of magnitude), thus scaling-up well for large databases.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we study the node distribution of an R-tree storing region data, like, for instance, islands, lakes, or human-inhabited areas. We will show that real region datasets are packed in an R-tree into minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) whose area distribution follows the same power law, named REGAL (REGion Area Law), as that for the regions themselves. Moreover, these MBRs are packed in their turn into MBRs following the same law, and so on iteratively, up to the root of the R-tree. Based on this observation, we are able to accurately estimate the search effort for range queries, using a small number of easy-to-retrieve parameters. Furthermore, since our analysis exploits, through a realistic mathematical model, the proximity relations existing among the regions in the dataset, we show how to use our model to predict the selectivity of a self-spatial join query posed on the dataset. Experiments on a variety of real datasets (islands, lakes, human-inhabited areas) show that our estimations are accurate, enjoying a geometric average relative error ranging from 22 percent to 32 percent for the search effort of a range query, and from 14 percent to 34 percent for the selectivity of a self-spatial join query. This is significantly better than using a naive model based on uniformity assumption, which gives rise to a geometric average relative error up to 270 percent and up to 85 percent for the two problems, respectively.

    :abstractText: "Spatial data appear in numerous applications, such as GISmultimediaand even traditional databases. Most of the analysis on spatial data has focused on point data, typically using the uniformity assumption, or, more accurately, a fractal distribution. However, no results exist for nonpoint spatial data, like 2D regions (e.g., islands), 3D volumes (e.g., physical objects in the real world), etc. This is exactly the problem we solve in this paper. Based on experimental evidence that real areas and volumes follow a \xC2\xBFpower law,\xC2\xBF that we named REGAL (REGion Area Law), we show 1) the theoretical implications of our model and its connection with the ubiquitous fractals and 2) the first of its practical uses, namely, the selectivity estimation for range queries. Experiments on a variety of real data sets (islands, lakes, and human-inhabited areas) show that our method is extremely accurate, enjoying a maximum relative error ranging from 1 to 5 percent, versus 30-70 percent of a naive model that uses the uniformity assumption."

    :abstractText: "Many recent database applications must deal with similarity queries. For such applications, it is important to measure the similarity between two objects using the distance between them. Focusing on this problem, this paper proposes the Slim-tree, a new dynamic tree for organizing metric data sets in pages of fixed size. The Slim-tree uses the triangle inequality to prune distance calculations needed to answer similarity queries over objects in metric spaces. The proposed insertion algorithm uses new policies to select the nodes where incoming objects are stored. When a node overflows, the Slim-tree uses a Minimal Spanning Tree to help with the split. The new insertion algorithm leads to a tree with high storage utilization and improved query performance. The Slim-tree is the first metric access method to tackle the problem of overlap between nodes in metric spaces and to propose a technique to minimize it. The proposed \xC2\xBFfat-factor\xC2\xBF is a way to quantify whether a given tree can be improved and also to compare two trees. We show how to use the fat-factor to achieve accurate estimates of the search performance and also how to improve the performance of a metric tree through the proposed \xC2\xBFSlim-down\xC2\xBF algorithm. This paper also presents a new tool in the arsenal of resources of Slim-tree aimed at visualizing it. Visualization is a powerful tool for interactive data mining and for the visual tracking of the behavior of a tree under updates. Finally, we present a formula to estimate the number of disk accesses in range queries. Results from experiments with real and synthetic data sets show that the new algorithms of the Slim-tree lead to performance improvements. These results show that the Slim-tree outperforms the M-tree up to 200 percent for range queries. For insertion and split, the Minimal-Spanning-Tree-based algorithm achieves up to 40 times faster insertions. We observed improvements up to 40 percent in range queries after applying the Slim-down algorithm."

    :abstractText: Signature files seem to be a promising access method for text and attributes. According to this method, the documents (or records) are stored sequentially in one file ("text file"), while abstractions of the documents ("signatures") are stored sequentially in another file ("signature file"). In order to resolve a query, the signature file is scanned first, and many nonqualifying documents are immediately rejected. We develop a framework that includes primary key hashing, multiattribute hashing, and signature files. Our effort is to find the optimal signature extraction method. The main contribution of this paper is that we present optimal and efficient suboptimal algorithms for assigning words to signatures in several environments. Another contribution is that we use information theory, and study the relationship of the false drop probability Fd and the information that is lost during signature extraction. We give tight lower bounds on the achievable Fd and show that a simple relationship holds between the two quantities in the case of optimal signature extraction with uniform occurrence and query frequencies. We examine hashing as a method to map words to signatures (instead of the optimal way), and show that the same relationship holds between Fd and loss, indicating that an invariant may exist between these two quantities for every signature extraction method.

    :abstractText: The problem of selectivity estimation for queries of nontraditional databases is still an open issue. In this article, we examine the problem of selectivity estimation for some types of spatial queries in databases containing real data. We have shown earlier [Faloutsos and Kamel 1994] that real point sets typically have a nonuniform distribution, violating consistently the uniformity and independence assumptions. Moreover, we demonstrated that the theory of fractals can help to describe real point sets. In this article we show how the concept of fractal dimension, i.e., (noninteger) dimension, can lead to the solution for the selectivity estimation problem in spatial databases. Among the infinite family of fractal dimensions, we consider here the Hausdorff fractal dimension D0 and the &ldquo;Correlation&rdquo; fractal dimension D2. Specifically, we show that (a) the average number of neighbors for a given point set follows a power law, with D2 as exponent, and (b) the average number of nonempty range queries follows a power law with E &minus; D0 as exponent (E is the dimension of the embedding space). We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for &ldquo;biased&rdquo; range queries, for self-spatial joins, and for the average number of nonempty range queries. The result of some experiments on real and synthetic point sets are shown. Our formulas achieve very low relative errors, typically about 10%, versus 40%&ndash;100% of the formulas that are based on the uniformity and independence assumptions.

    :abstractText: Signature files have attracted a lot of interest as an access method for text and specifically for messages in the office environment. Messages are stored sequentially in the message file, whereas their hash-coded abstractions (signatures) are stored sequentially in the signature file. To answer a query, the signature file is examined first, and many nonqualifying messages are immediately rejected. In this paper we examine the problem of designing signature extraction methods and studying their performance. We describe two old methods, generalize another one, and propose a new method and its variation. We provide exact and approximate formulas for the dependency between the false drop probability and the signature size for all the methods, and we show that the proposed method (VBC) achieves approximately ten times smaller false drop probability than the old methods, whereas it is well suited for collections of documents with variable document sizes.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we study and characterize the topology of the Internet at the autonomous system (AS) level. First, we show that the topology can be described efficiently with power laws. The elegance and simplicity of the power laws provide a novel perspective into the seemingly uncontrolled Internet structure. Second, we show that power laws have appeared consistently over the last five years. We also observe that the power laws hold even in the most recent and more complete topology with correlation coefficient above 99% for the degree-based power law. In addition, we study the evolution of the power-law exponents over the five-year interval and observe a variation for the degree-based power law of less than 10%. Third, we provide relationships between the exponents and other topological metrics.

    :abstractText: It is suggested that Gray codes be used to improve the performance of methods for partial match and range queries. Specifically, the author illustrates the improved clustering of similar records that Gray codes can achieve with multiattribute hashing. Gray codes are used instead of binary codes to map record signatures to buckets. In Gray codes, successive codewords differ in the value of exactly one bit position; thus, successive buckets hold records with similar record signatures. The proposed method achieves better clustering of similar records, thus reducing the I/O time. A mathematical model is developed to derive formulas giving the average performance of both methods, and it is shown that the proposed method achieves 0-50% relative savings over the binary codes. The author also discusses how Gray codes could be applied to some retrieval methods designed for range queries, such as the grid file and the approach based on the so-called z-ordering. Gray codes are also used to design good distance-preserving functions, which map a k-dimensional (k-D) space into a one-dimensional one, in such a way that points are close in the k-D space are likely to be close in the 1-D space.

    :abstractText: Pictorial databases require efficient and direct spatial search based on the analog form of spatial objects and relationships instead of search based on some cumbersome alphanumeric encodings of the pictures. A description is given of PSQL, a query language that allows pictorial domains to be presented to the user in their analog form and allows him or her to do direct manipulation on the objects found on those domains. Direct spatial search and computation on the pictures is done using efficient data structures, R- and R/sup trees (multidimensional B-trees), which are excellent devices for searching spatial objects and relationships found on pictures.

    :abstractText: Commercially available database systems do not meet the information and processing needs of design and manufacturing environments. A new generation of systems-engineering information systems-must be built to meet these needs. The architectural and computational aspects of such systems are addressed, and solutions are proposed. The authors argue that a mainframe-workstation architecture is needed to provide distributed functionality while ensuring high availability and low communication overhead, that explicit control of metaknowledge is needed to support extendibility and evolution, that large rule bases are needed to make the knowledge of the systems active, and that incremental computation models are needed to achieve the required performance of such engineering information systems.

    :abstractText: "Association Rule Mining algorithms operate on a data matrix (e.g., customers $\\times$ products) to derive association rules [AIS93b, SA96]. We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, which are quantifiable in that we can measure the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of a set of discovered rules. We also propose the &ldquo;guessing error&rdquo; as a measure of the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo;, that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our rules can &ldquo;guess&rdquo; the amount spent on butter. Thus, unlike association rules, Ratio Rules can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show that we can compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the data set with small memory requirements (a few small matrices), in contrast to association rule mining methods which require multiple passes and/or large memory. Experiments on several real data sets (e.g., basketball and baseball statistics, biological data) demonstrate that the proposed method: (a) leads to rules that make sense; (b) can find large itemsets in binary matrices, even in the presence of noise; and (c) consistently achieves a &ldquo;guessing error&rdquo; of up to 5 times less than using straightforward column averages."

    :abstractText: We propose a file structure to index high-dimensionality data, which are typically points in some feature space. The idea is to use only a few of the features, using additional features only when the additional discriminatory power is absolutely necessary. We present in detail the design of our tree structure and the associated algorithms that handle such "varying length" feature vectors. Finally, we report simulation results, comparing the proposed structure with the R*-tree, which is one of the most successful methods for low-dimensionality spaces. The results illustrate the superiority of our method, which saves up to 80% in disk accesses.

    :abstractText: Sensor devices and embedded processors are becoming widespread, especially in measurement/monitoring applications. Their limited resources (CPU, memory and/or communication bandwidth, and power) pose some interesting challenges. We need concise, expressive models to represent the important features of the data and that lend themselves to efficient estimation. In particular, under these severe constraints, we want models and estimation methods that (a) require little memory and a single pass over the data, (b) can adapt and handle arbitrary periodic components, and (c) can deal with various types of noise. We propose ${\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ (Arbitrary Window Stream mOdeling Method), which allows sensors in remote or hostile environments to efficiently and effectively discover interesting patterns and trends. This can be done automatically, i.e., with no prior inspection of the data or any user intervention and expert tuning before or during data gathering. Our algorithms require limited resources and can thus be incorporated into sensors - possibly alongside a distributed query processing engine [10,6,27]. Updates are performed in constant time with respect to stream size using logarithmic space. Existing forecasting methods (SARIMA, GARCH, etc.) and &#x201c;traditional&#x201d; Fourier and wavelet analysis fall short on one or more of these requirements. To the best of our knowledge, ${\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ is the first framework that combines all of the above characteristics. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that ${\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ discovers meaningful patterns over long time periods. Thus, the patterns can also be used to make long-range forecasts, which are notoriously difficult to perform. In fact, ${\mathrm{AWSOM}}$ outperforms manually set up autoregressive models, both in terms of long-term pattern detection and modeling and by at least 10 x in resource consumption.

    :abstractText: Similarity search operations require executing expensive algorithms, and although broadly useful in many new applications, they rely on specific structures not yet supported by commercial DBMS. In this paper we discuss the new Omni-technique, which allows to build a variety of dynamic Metric Access Methods based on a number of selected objects from the dataset, used as global reference objects. We call them as the Omni-family of metric access methods. This technique enables building similarity search operations on top of existing structures, significantly improving their performance, regarding the number of disk access and distance calculations. Additionally, our methods scale up well, exhibiting sub-linear behavior with growing database size.

    :abstractText: How do real graphs evolve over time&quest; What are normal growth patterns in social, technological, and information networks&quest; Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time. Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)). Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study. We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between the nodes are generated around this transition point. Last, we analyze the connection between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph. We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.

    :abstractText: "How do we find a natural clustering of a real-world point set which contains an unknown number of clusters with different shapes, and which may be contaminated by noise&quest; As most clustering algorithms were designed with certain assumptions (Gaussianity), they often require the user to give input parameters, and are sensitive to noise. In this article, we propose a robust framework for determining a natural clustering of a given dataset, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The proposed framework, robust information-theoretic clustering (RIC), is orthogonal to any known clustering algorithm: Given a preliminary clustering, RIC purifies these clusters from noise, and adjusts the clusterings such that it simultaneously determines the most natural amount and shape (subspace) of the clusters. Our RIC method can be combined with any clustering technique ranging from K-means and K-medoids to advanced methods such as spectral clustering. In fact, RIC is even able to purify and improve an initial coarse clustering, even if we start with very simple methods. In an extension, we propose a fully automatic stand-alone clustering method and efficiency improvements. RIC scales well with the dataset size. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the proposed RIC framework."

However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and keyword in the previous example). We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity. We implement all our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets."

    :abstractText: "The amount of biological data publicly available has experienced an exponential growth as the technology advances. Online databases are now playing an important role as information repositories as well as easily accessible platforms for researchers to communicate and contribute. Recent research projects in image bioinformatics produce a number of databases of images, which visualize the spatial expression pattern of a gene (eg. \"fj\"), and most of which also have one or several annotation keywords (eg., \"embryonic hindgut\"). C-DEM is an online system for Drosophila (= fruit-fly) Embryo images Mining. It supports queries from all three modalities to all three, namely, (a) genes, (b) images of gene expression, and (c) annotation keywords of the images. Thus, it can find images that are similar to a given image, and/or related to the desirable annotation keywords, and/or related to specific genes. Typical queries are what are most suitable keywords to assign to image insitu28465.jpg or find images that are related to gene \"fj\", and to the keyword \"embryonic hindgut\". C-DEM uses state-of-the-art feature extraction methods for images (wavelets and principal component analysis). It envisions the whole database as a tri-partite graph (one type for each modality), and it uses fast and flexible proximity measures, namely, random walk with restarts (RWR). In addition to flexible querying, C-DEM allows for navigation: the user can click on the results of an earlier query (image thumbnails and/or keywords and/or genes), and the system will report the most related images (and keywords, and genes). The demo is on a real Drosophila Embryo database, with 10,204 images, 2,969 distinct genes, and 113 annotation keywords. The query response time is below one second on a commodity desktop."

    :abstractText: How do graphs look like? How do they evolve over time? How can we generate realistic-looking graphs? We review some static and temporal 'laws', and we describe the "Kronecker" graph generator, which naturally matches all of the known properties of real graphs. Moreover, we present tools for discovering anomalies and patterns in two types of graphs, static and time-evolving. For the former, we present the 'CenterPiece' subgraphs (CePS), which expects q query nodes (eg., suspicious people) and finds the node that is best connected to all q of them (eg., the master mind of a criminal group). We also show how to compute CenterPiece subgraphs efficiently. For the time evolving graphs, we present tensor-based methods, and apply them on real data, like the DBLP author-paper dataset, where they are able to find natural research communities, and track their evolution.Finally, we also briefly mention some results on influence and virus propagation on real graphs, as well as on the emerging map/reduce approach and its impact on large graph mining.

    :abstractText: "Counting the number of triangles in a graph is a beautiful algorithmic problem which has gained importance over the last years due to its significant role in complex network analysis. Metrics frequently computed such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio involve the execution of a triangle counting algorithm. Furthermore, several interesting graph mining applications rely on computing the number of triangles in the graph of interest. In this paper, we focus on the problem of counting triangles in a graph. We propose a practical method, out of which all triangle counting algorithms can potentially benefit. Using a straightforward triangle counting algorithm as a black box, we performed 166 experiments on real-world networks and on synthetic datasets as well, where we show that our method works with high accuracy, typically more than 99% and gives significant speedups, resulting in even \xE2\x89\x88 130 times faster performance."

    :abstractText: "Most of recommender systems try to find items that are most relevant to the older choices of a given user. Here we focus on the \"surprise me\" query: A user may be bored with his/her usual genre of items (e.g., books, movies, hobbies), and may want a recommendation that is related, but off the beaten path, possibly leading to a new genre of books/movies/hobbies. How would we define, as well as automate, this seemingly selfcontradicting request? We introduce TANGENT, a novel recommendation algorithm to solve this problem. The main idea behind TANGENT is to envision the problem as node selection on a graph, giving high scores to nodes that are well connected to the older choices, and at the same time well connected to unrelated choices. The method is carefully designed to be (a) parameter-free (b) effective and (c) fast. We illustrate the benefits of TANGENT with experiments on both synthetic and real data sets. We show that TANGENT makes reasonable, yet surprising, horizon-broadening recommendations. Moreover, it is fast and scalable, since it can easily use existing fast algorithms on graph node proximity."

    :abstractText: "Given a real, and weighted person-to-person network which changes over time, what can we say about the cliques that it contains? Do the incidents of communication, or weights on the edges of a clique follow any pattern? Real, and in-person social networks have many more triangles than chance would dictate. As it turns out, there are many more cliques than one would expect, in surprising patterns. In this paper, we study massive real-world social networks formed by direct contacts among people through various personal communication services, such as Phone-Call, SMS, IM etc. The contributions are the following: (a) we discover surprising patterns with the cliques, (b) we report power-laws of the weights on the edges of cliques, (c) our real networks follow these patterns such that we can trust them to spot outliers and finally, (d) we propose the first utility-driven graph generator for weighted time-evolving networks, which match the observed patterns. Our study focused on three large datasets, each of which is a different type of communication service, with over one million records, and spans several months of activity."

Monitoring and mining BGP update messages can directly reveal the health and stability of Internet routing. Here we make two contributions: firstly we find patterns in BGP updates, like self-similarity, power-law and lognormal marginals; secondly using these patterns, we find anomalies. Specifically, we develop BGP-lens, an automated BGP updates analysis tool, that has three desirable properties: (a) It is effective, able to identify phenomena that would otherwise go unnoticed, such as a peculiar 'clothesline' behavior or prolonged 'spikes' that last as long as 8 hours; (b) It is scalable, using algorithms are all linear on the number of time-ticks; and (c) It is admin-friendly, giving useful leads for phenomenon of interest. We showcase the capabilities of BGP-lens by identifying surprising phenomena verified by syadmins, over a massive trace of BGP updates spanning 2 years, from the publicly available site datapository.net."

    :abstractText: Given multiple time sequences with missing values, we propose DynaMMo which summarizes, compresses, and finds latent variables. The idea is to discover hidden variables and learn their dynamics, making our algorithm able to function even when there are missing values. We performed experiments on both real and synthetic datasets spanning several megabytes, including motion capture sequences and chlorine levels in drinking water. We show that our proposed DynaMMo method (a) can successfully learn the latent variables and their evolution; (b) can provide high compression for little loss of reconstruction accuracy; (c) can extract compact but powerful features for segmentation, interpretation, and forecasting; (d) has complexity linear on the duration of sequences.

    :abstractText: Classifying nodes in networks is a task with a wide range of applications. It can be particularly useful in anomaly and fraud detection. Many resources are invested in the task of fraud detection due to the high cost of fraud, and being able to automatically detect potential fraud quickly and precisely allows human investigators to work more efficiently. Many data analytic schemes have been put into use; however, schemes that bolster link analysis prove promising. This work builds upon the belief propagation algorithm for use in detecting collusion and other fraud schemes. We propose an algorithm called SNARE (Social Network Analysis for Risk Evaluation). By allowing one to use domain knowledge as well as link knowledge, the method was very successful for pinpointing misstated accounts in our sample of general ledger data, with a significant improvement over the default heuristic in true positive rates, and a lift factor of up to 6.5 (more than twice that of the default heuristic). We also apply SNARE to the task of graph labeling in general on publicly-available datasets. We show that with only some information about the nodes themselves in a network, we get surprisingly high accuracy of labels. Not only is SNARE applicable in a wide variety of domains, but it is also robust to the choice of parameters and highly scalable-linearly with the number of edges in a graph.

Given the potential computational complexity, we mainly devote ourselves to addressing the computational issues in this paper by proposing an efficient solution (referred to as iPoG-B) for bipartite graphs. Our experimental results show that the proposed fast solution (iPoGB) achieves significant speedup, while leading to the same ranking result.

Our model has the following properties: it is (a) flexible, capable of generating the cross product of weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected, uni/bipartite graphs; (b) realistic, giving graphs that obey eleven static and dynamic laws that real graphs follow (we formally prove that for several of the (power) laws and we estimate their exponents as a function of the model parameters); (c) parsimonious, requiring only four parameters. (d) fast, being linear on the number of edges; (e) simple, intuitively leading to the generation of macroscopic patterns. We empirically show that our model mimics two real-world graphs very well: Blognet (unipartite, undirected, unweighted) with 27 K nodes and 125 K edges; and Committee-to-Candidate campaign donations (bipartite, directed, weighted) with 23 K nodes and 880 K edges. We also show how to handle time so that edge/weight additions are bursty and self-similar."

    :abstractText: We introduce a new representation for time series, the Multiresolution Vector Quantized (MVQ) approximation, along with a distance function. Similar to Discrete Wavelet Transform, MVQ keeps both local and global information about the data. However, instead of keeping low-level time series values, it maintains high-level feature information (key subsequences), facilitating the introduction of more meaningful similarity measures. The method is fast and scales linearly with the database size and dimensionality. Contrary to previous methods, the vast majority of which use the Euclidean distance, MVQ uses a multiresolution/hierarchical distance function. In our experiments, the proposed technique consistently outperforms the other major methods.

How do we monitor (i) the centrality of an individual node (e.g. which is the most important conference), or (ii) the proximity of two nodes or sets of nodes (e.g. who are the most influential authors with respect to a particular conference)? How can we do this efficiently and incrementally? How can we provide &lsquo;any-time&rsquo; answers to interesting queries, with respect to node centrality or proximity? In this paper we propose pTrack and cTrack, which are based on RWR, together with some important modifications to adapt these measures to a dynamic, evolving setting. Additionally, we develop techniques for fast, incremental updates of these measures that allow us to track them continuously as link updates arrive. In addition, we discuss variants of our method that can handle batch updates, as well as place more emphasis on recent links.

    :abstractText: "Given a large sparse graph, how can we find patterns and anomalies? Several important applications can be modeled as large sparse graphs, e.g., network traffic monitoring, research citation network analysis, social network analysis, and financial transactions. Low-rank decompositions, such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and CUR, are powerful techniques for revealing latent-hidden variables and associated patterns from high dimensional data. However, those methods often ignore the sparsity property of the graph, and hence usually incur too high memory and computational cost to be practical. We propose a novel method, the Compact Matrix Decomposition (CMD), to compute sparse low-rank approximations. CMD dramatically reduces both the computation cost and the space requirements over existing decomposition methods singular value decomposition (SVD) and CUR. Using CMD as the key building block, we further propose procedures to efficiently construct and analyze dynamic graphs from real-time application data. We provide theoretical guarantee for our methods, and present results on two real, large datasets, one on network flow data (100 GB trace of 22K hosts over one month) and one on DBLP (200 MB over 25 years). We show that CMD is often an order of magnitude more efficient than the state of the art (SVD and CUR): it is over 10X faster, but requires less than 1-10 of the space, for the same reconstruction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate how CMD is used for detecting anomalies and monitoring time-evolving graphs, in which it successfully detects worm-like hierarchical scanning patterns in real network data.

    :abstractText: Triangle counting is an important problem in graph mining. The clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio,two commonly used measures effectively quantify the triangle density in order to quantify the fact that friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Furthermore, several successful graph mining applications rely on the number of triangles. In this paper, we study the problem of counting triangles in large, power-law networks. Our algorithm, SparcifyingEigenTriangle, relies on the spectral properties of power-law networks and the Achlioptas-McSherry sparsification process. SparcifyingEigenTriangle is easy to parallelize, fast and accurate.We verify the validity of our approach with several experiments in real-world graphs, where we achieve at the same time high accuracy and important speedup versus a straight-forward exact counting competitor.

    :abstractText: We report a surprising, persistent pattern in an important class of large sparse social graphs, which we term EigenSpokes. We focus on large Mobile Call graphs, spanning hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges, and find that the singular vectors of these graphs exhibit a striking EigenSpokes pattern wherein, when plotted against each other, they have clear, separate lines that often neatly align along specific axes (hence the term "spokes"). We show this phenomenon to be persistent across both temporal and geographic samples of Mobile Call graphs. Through experiments on synthetic graphs, EigenSpokes are shown to be associated with the presence of community structure in these social networks. This is further verified by analysing the eigenvectors of the Mobile Call graph, which yield nodes that form tightly-knit communities. The presence of such patterns in the singular spectra has useful applications, and could potentially be used to design simple, efficient community extraction algorithms.

    :abstractText: "We propose a new, recursive model to generate realistic graphs, evolving over time. Our model has the following properties: it is (a) flexible, capable of generating the cross product of weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected, uni/bipartite graphs; (b) realistic, giving graphs that obey eleven static and dynamic laws that real graphs follow (we formally prove that for several of the (power) laws and we estimate their exponents as a function of the model parameters); (c) parsimonious, requiring only four parameters. (d) fast, being linear on the number of edges; (e) simple, intuitively leading to the generation of macroscopic patterns. We empirically show that our model mimics two real-world graphs very well: Blognet (unipartite, undirected, unweighted) with 27 K nodes and 125 K edges; and Committee-to-Candidate campaign donations (bipartite, directed, weighted) with 23 K nodes and 880 K edges. We also show how to handle time so that edge/weight additions are bursty and self-similar."

    :abstractText: "Advances in data collection and storage capacity have made it increasingly possible to collect highly volatile graph data for analysis. Existing graph analysis techniques are not appropriate for such data, especially in cases where streaming or near-real-time results are required. An example that has drawn significant research interest is the cyber-security domain, where internet communication traces are collected and real-time discovery of events, behaviors, patterns, and anomalies is desired. We propose MetricForensics, a scalable framework for analysis of volatile graphs. MetricForensics combines a multi-level \"drill down\" approach, a collection of user-selected graph metrics, and a collection of analysis techniques. At each successive level, more sophisticated metrics are computed and the graph is viewed at finer temporal resolutions. In this way, MetricForensics scales to highly volatile graphs by only allocating resources for computationally expensive analysis when an interesting event is discovered at a coarser resolution first. We test MetricForensics on three real-world graphs: an enterprise IP trace, a trace of legitimate and malicious network traffic from a research institution, and the MIT Reality Mining proximity sensor data. Our largest graph has 3M vertices and 32M edges, spanning 4.5 days. The results demonstrate the scalability and capability of MetricForensics in analyzing volatile graphs; and highlight four novel phenomena in such graphs: elbows, broken correlations, prolonged spikes, and lightweight stars."

    :abstractText: "How can we generate realistic networks? In addition, how can we do so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in- and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as \"Kronecker graphs\". First, we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present KRONFIT, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, KRONFIT takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks show that KRONFIT finds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties of target networks. In fact, using just four parameters we can accurately model several aspects of global network structure. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain insights about the network structure, and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for null-models, anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization.

    :abstractText: In many sensing applications we must continuously gather information to provide a good estimate of the state of the environment at every point in time. A robot may tour an environment, gathering information every hour. In a wireless sensor network, these tours correspond to packets being transmitted. In these settings, we are often faced with resource restrictions, like energy constraints. The users issue queries with certain expectations on the answer quality. Thus, we must optimize the tours to ensure the satisfaction of the user constraints, while at the same time minimize the cost of the query plan. For a single timestep, this optimization problem is NP-hard, but recent approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees provide good solutions. In this paper, we present a new efficient algorithm, exploiting dynamic programming and submodularity of the information collected, that efficiently plans data collection tours for an entire (finite) horizon. Our algorithm can use any single step procedure as a black box, and, based on its properties, provides strong theoretical guarantees for the solution. We also provide an extensive empirical analysis demonstrating the benefits of nonmyopic planning in two real world sensing applications.

    :abstractText: Tree-based indexes are integral to efficient querying in multimedia and GIS applications. We propose algorithms to reduce the number of I/Os performed in these common data structures. Multidimensional indexes frequently use shapes to describe the data stored in the subtree below a given rectangle. For example, the popular R*-tree uses minimum bounding rectangles. Our approach creates boolean combinations of rectangles to replace the original rectangles if there is free space on the node to do so. We implemented and tested several algorithms for deciding which rectangles in an index node to replace with multiple rectangles, and implemented and tested several methods for deciding which nodes in the index to improve when available CPU time is limited. We ran experiments over a variety of real and synthetic data sets, examining the performance benefit of the various index node tuning algorithms. Experiments show that up to fifty percent of the unnecessary I/Os caused by imprecise data descriptors can be eliminated using our algorithms.

    :abstractText: Wireless sensor networks are proving to be useful in a variety of settings. A core challenge in these networks is to minimize energy consumption. Prior database research has proposed to achieve this by pushing data-reducing operators like aggregation and selection down into the network. This approach has proven unpopular with early adopters of sensor network technology, who typically want to extract complete "dumps" of the sensor readings, i.e., to run "SELECT *" queries. Unfortunately, because these queries do no data reduction, they consume significant energy in current sensornet query processors. In this paper we attack the "SELECT " problem for sensor networks. We propose a robust approximate technique called Ken that uses replicated dynamic probabilistic models to minimize communication from sensor nodes to the network's PC base station. In addition to data collection, we show that Ken is well suited to anomaly- and event-detection applications. A key challenge in this work is to intelligently exploit spatial correlations across sensor nodes without imposing undue sensor-to-sensor communication burdens to maintain the models. Using traces from two real-world sensor network deployments, we demonstrate that relatively simple models can provide significant communication (and hence energy) savings without undue sacrifice in result quality or frequency. Choosing optimally among even our simple models is NPhard, but our experiments show that a greedy heuristic performs nearly as well as an exhaustive algorithm.

    :abstractText: Many of the data sources used in stream query processing are known to exhibit bursty behavior. We focus here on passive network monitoring, an application in which the data rates typically exhibit a large peak-to-average ratio. Provisioning a stream query processor to handle peak rates in such a setting can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem by provisioning the query processor for typical data rates instead of much higher peak data rates. To enable this strategy, we present mechanisms and policies for managing the tradeoffs between the latency and accuracy of query results when bursts exceed the steady-state capacity of the query processor. We describe the current status of our implementation and present experimental results on a testbed network monitoring application to demonstrate the utility of our approach

    :abstractText: The long-running nature of continuous queries coupled with their high scalability requirements poses new challanges for dataflow processing. CQ systems execute pipelined dataflows that are shared across multiple queries and whose scalability is limited by their constituent, stateful operators -- e.g. a windowed groupby-aggregate. To scale such operators, a natural solution is to partition them across a shared-nothing platform. But in the CQ context, traditional, static techniques for partitioned parallelism can exhibit detrimental imbalances as workload and runtime conditions evolve. Long-running CQ dataflows must continue to function robustly in the face of these imbalances. To address this challenge, we introduce a dataflow operator called Flux that encapsulates adaptive state partitioning and dataflow routing. Flux is placed between producer-consumer stages in a dataflow pipeline to repartition stateful operators while the pipeline is still executing. We present the Flux architecture, along with repartitioning policies that can be used for CQ operators under shifting processing and memory loads. We show that the Flux mechanism and these policies can provide several factors improvement in throughput, and orders of magnitude improvement in average latency over the static case.

    :abstractText: We present the design and analysis of a customized access method for the content-based image retrieval system, Blobworld. Using the amdb access method analysis tool, we analyzed three existing multidimensional access methods to support nearest neighbor search in the context of the Blobworld application. Based on this analysis, we propose several variants of the R-tree, tailored to address the problems the analysis revealed. We implemented the access methods we propose in the Generalized Search Trees (GiST) framework and analyzed them. We found that two of our access methods have better performance characteristics for the Blobworld application than any of the traditional multi-dimensional access methods we examined. Based on this experience, we draw conclusions for nearest neighbor access method design, and for the task of constructing custom access methods tailored to particular applications.

    :abstractText: The convergence of embedded sensor systems and stream query processing suggests an important role for database techniques, in managing data that only partially and of- ten inaccurately capture the state of the world. Reasoning about uncertainty as a first class citizen, inside a database system, becomes an increasingly important operation for processing non deterministic data. An essential step for such an approach lies in the choice of the appropriate un- certainty model, that captures the probabilistic information in the data, both accurately and at the right semantic de- tail level. This paper introduces Hierarchical First-Order Graphical Models (HFGMs), an intuitive and economical representation of the data correlations stored in a Proba- bilistic Data Management system, in a hierarchical setting. HFGM semantics allow for an efficient summarization of the probabilistic model that can be induced from a dataset at various levels of granularity, effectively controlling the trade-off of the model's complexity vs its accuracy.

    :abstractText: "A large number of database index structures have been proposed over the last two decades, and little consensus has emerged regarding their relative effectiveness. In order to empirically evaluate these indexes, it is helpful to have methodologies for generating random queries for performance testing. In this paper we propose a natural, domain-independent approach to the generation of random queries for experimenting with indexes: choose randomly among all logically distinct queries. We investigate this idea in the context of a widely-used and widely-studied indexing workload: range queries over 2-dimensional points. We present an algorithm that chooses randomly among logically distinct 2-d range queries. It has constant-time expected performance over uniformly distributed data, and exhibited good performance in experiments over a variety of real and synthetic data sets. We observe nonuniformities in the way randomly chosen logical 2-d range queries are distributed over a variety of spatial properties. This raises questions about the quality of the workloads generated from such queries. To explore this further, we contrast our approach of choosing random logical range queries with previous work that generates workloads of random spatial ranges. We highlight pros and cons of the alternate approaches, and sketch directions for future work on the robust generation of workloads for studying index performance."

    :abstractText: Sensor network applications tend to exhibit significant high-level commonalities along several major dimensions that have heretofore been underexposed, particularly in the areas of collection and dissemination. We have developed a component library, sdlib, which presents the fundamental abstractions of collection and dissemination as part of a dataflow sytem. This allows application developers to rapidly develop applications at the nesC level. This means that sdlib maintains significant expressivity while operating efficiently.We have built four applications, each faithful to a mature monolithic application, on top of sdlib to compare its performance to that of original. We find that applications implemented with sdlib are much simpler to write, just as resource efficient, and perform comparably to monolithic implementations.

    :abstractText: A basic task in sensor networks is to interactively gather data from a subset of the sensor nodes. When data needs to be gathered from a selected set of nodes in the network, existing communication schemes often behave poorly. In this paper, we study the algorithmic challenges in efficiently routing a fixed-size packet through a small number of nodes in a sensor network, picking up data as the query is routed. We show that computing the optimal routing scheme to visit a specific set of nodes is NP-complete, but we develop approximation algorithms that produce plans with costs within a constant factor of the optimum. We enhance the robustness of our initial approach to accommodate the practical issues of limited-sized packets as well as network link and node failures, and examine how different approaches behave with dynamic changes in the network topology. Our theoretical results are validated via an implementation of our algorithms on the TinyOS platform and a controlled simulation study using Matlab and TOSSIM.

    :abstractText: We present the Tiny AGgregation (TAG) service for aggregation in low-power, distributed, wireless environments. TAG allows users to express simple, declarative queries and have them distributed and executed efficiently in networks of low-power, wireless sensors. We discuss various generic properties of aggregates, and show how those properties affect the performance of our in network approach. We include a performance study demonstrating the advantages of our approach over traditional centralized, out-of-network methods, and discuss a variety of optimizations for improving the performance and fault-tolerance of the basic solution.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a new persistent data management layer designed to simplify cluster-based Internet service construction. This self-managing layer, called a distributed data structure (DDS), presents a conventional single-site data structure interface to service authors, but partitions and replicates the data across a cluster. We have designed and implemented a distributed hash table DDS that has properties necessary for Internet services (incremental scaling of throughput and data capacity, fault tolerance and high availability, high concurrency, consistency, and durability). The hash table uses two-phase commits to present a coherent view of its data across all cluster nodes, allowing any node to service any task. We show that the distributed hash table simplifies Internet service construction by decoupling service-specific logic from the complexities of persistent, consistent state management, and by allowing services to inherit the necessary service properties from the DDS rather than having to implement the properties themselves. We have scaled the hash table to a 128 node cluster, 1 terabyte of storage, and an in-core read throughput of 61,432 operations/s and write throughput of 13,582 operations/s.

    :abstractText: "Sensor networks are notoriously difficult to program, given that they encompass the complexities of both distributed and embedded systems. To address this problem, we present the design and implementation of a declarative sensor network platform, DSN: a declarative language, compiler and runtime suitable for programming a broad range of sensornet applications. We demonstrate that our approach is a natural fit for sensor networks by specifying several very different classes of traditional sensor network protocols, services and applications entirely declaratively -- these include tree and geographic routing, link estimation, data collection, event tracking, version coherency, and localization. To our knowledge, this is the first time these disparate sensornet tasks have been addressed by a single high-level programming environment. Moreover, the declarative approach accommodates the desire for architectural flexibility and simple management of limited resources. Our results suggest that the declarative approach is well-suited to sensor networks, and that it can produce concise and flexible code by focusing on what the code is doing, and not on how it is doing it."

    :abstractText: "Recent research has shown that one can use Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) to build scalable, robust and efficient applications. One question that is often left unanswered is that of simplicity of implementation and deployment. In this paper, we explore a case study of building an application for which ease of deployment dominated the need for high performance. The application we focus on is Place Lab, an end-user positioning system. We evaluate whether it is feasible to use DHTs as an application-independent building block to implement a key component of Place Lab: its \"mapping infrastructure.\" We present Prefix Hash Trees, a data structure used by Place Lab for geographic range queries that is built entire on top of a standard DHT. By strictly layering Place Lab's data structures on top of a generic DHT service, we were able to decouple the deployment and management of Place Lab from that of the underlying DHT. We identify the characteristics of Place Lab that made it amenable for deploying in this layered manner, and comment on its effect on performance."

    :abstractText: The Internet's core routing infrastructure, while arguably robust and efficient, has proven to be difficult to evolve to accommodate the needs of new applications. Prior research on this problem has included new hard-coded routing protocols on the one hand, and fully extensible Active Networks on the other. In this paper, we explore a new point in this design space that aims to strike a better balance between the extensibility and robustness of a routing infrastructure. The basic idea of our solution, which we call declarative routing, is to express routing protocols using a database query language. We show that our query language is a natural fit for routing, and can express a variety of well-known routing protocols in a compact and clean fashion. We discuss the security of our proposal in terms of its computational expressive power and language design. Via simulation, and deployment on PlanetLab, we demonstrate that our system imposes no fundamental limits relative to traditional protocols, is amenable to query optimizations, and can sustain long-lived routes under network churn and congestion.

    :abstractText: Static analysis methods are given for determining whether arbitrary sets of database production rules are (1) guaranteed to terminate; (2) guaranteed to produce a unique final database state; (3) guaranteed to produce a unique stream of observable actions. When the analysis determines that one of these properties is not guaranteed, it isolates the rules responsible for the problem and determines criteria that, if satisfied, guarantee the property. The analysis methods are presented in the context of the Starburst Rule System; they will form the basis of an interactive development environment for Starburst rule programmers.

    :abstractText: We report the performance of NOW-Sort, a collection of sorting implementations on a Network of Workstations (NOW). We find that parallel sorting on a NOW is competitive to sorting on the large-scale SMPs that have traditionally held the performance records. On a 64-node cluster, we sort 6.0 GB in just under one minute, while a 32-node cluster finishes the Datamation benchmark in 2.41 seconds. Our implementations can be applied to a variety of disk, memory, and processor configurations; we highlight salient issues for tuning each component of the system. We evaluate the use of commodity operating systems and hardware for parallel sorting. We find existing OS primitives for memory management and file access adequate. Due to aggregate communication and disk bandwidth requirements, the bottleneck of our system is the workstation I/O bus.

Using new query processing algorithms, these technologies continuously improve estimates and confidence statistics. In addition, they react to user feedback, thereby giving the user control over the behavior of long-running operations. This demonstration displays the modifications to a database system and the resulting impact on aggregation queries, data visualization, and GUI widgets. We then compare this interactive behavior to batch-processing alternatives.

    :abstractText: We are developing a distributed query processor called PIER, which is designed to run on the scale of the entire Internet. PIER utilizes a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) as its communication substrate in order to achieve scalability, reliability, decentralized control, and load balancing. PIER enhances DHTs with declarative and algebraic query interfaces, and underneath those interfaces implements multihop, in-network versions of joins, aggregation, recursion, and query/result dissemination. PIER is currently being used for diverse applications, including network monitoring, keyword-based filesharing search, and network topology mapping. We will demonstrate PIER's functionality by showing system monitoring queries running on PlanetLab, a testbed of over 300 machines distributed across the globe.

    :abstractText: "We present a new family of join algorithms, called ripple joins, for online processing of multi-table aggregation queries in a relational database management system (DBMS). Such queries arise naturally in interactive exploratory decision-support applications. Traditional offline join algorithms are designed to minimize the time to completion of the query. In contrast, ripple joins are designed to minimize the time until an acceptably precise estimate of the query result is available, as measured by the length of a confidence interval. Ripple joins are adaptive, adjusting their behavior during processing in accordance with the statistical properties of the data. Ripple joins also permit the user to dynamically trade off the two key performance factors of on-line aggregation: the time between successive updates of the running aggregate, and the amount by which the confidence-interval length decreases at each update. We show how ripple joins can be implemented in an existing DBMS using iterators, and we give an overview of the methods used to compute confidence intervals and to adaptively optimize the ripple join &ldquo;aspect-ratio&rdquo; parameters. In experiments with an initial implementation of our algorithms in the POSTGRES DBMS, the time required to produce reasonably precise online estimates was up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the time required for the best offline join algorithms to produce exact answers."

    :abstractText: Recent work in query optimization has addressed the issue of placing expensive predicates in a query plan. In this paper we explore the predicate placement options considered in the Montage DBMS, presenting a family of algorithms that form successively more complex and effective optimization solutions. Through analysis and performance measurements of Montage SQL queries, we classify queries and highlight the simplest solution that will optimize each class correctly. We demonstrate limitations of previously published algorithms, and discuss the challenges and feasibility of implementing the various algorithms in a commercial-grade system.

    :abstractText: In large federated and shared-nothing databases, resources can exhibit widely fluctuating characteristics. Assumptions made at the time a query is submitted will rarely hold throughout the duration of query processing. As a result, traditional static query optimization and execution techniques are ineffective in these environments. In this paper we introduce a query processing mechanism called an eddy, which continuously reorders operators in a query plan as it runs. We characterize the moments of symmetry during which pipelined joins can be easily reordered, and the synchronization barriers that require inputs from different sources to be coordinated. By combining eddies with appropriate join algorithms, we merge the optimization and execution phases of query processing, allowing each tuple to have a flexible ordering of the query operators. This flexibility is controlled by a combination of fluid dynamics and a simple learning algorithm. Our initial implementation demonstrates promising results, with eddies performing nearly as well as a static optimizer/executor in static scenarios, and providing dramatic improvements in dynamic execution environments.

    :abstractText: "Aggregation in traditional database systems is performed in batch mode: a query is submitted, the system processes a large volume of data over a long period of time, and, eventually, the final answer is returned. This archaic approach is frustrating to users and has been abandoned in most other areas of computing. In this paper we propose a new online aggregation interface that permits users to both observe the progress of their aggregation queries and control execution on the fly. After outlining usability and performance requirements for a system supporting online aggregation, we present a suite of techniques that extend a database system to meet these requirements. These include methods for returning the output in random order, for providing control over the relative rate at which different aggregates are computed, and for computing running confidence intervals. Finally, we report on an initial implementation of online aggregation in POSTGRES."

    :abstractText: Object-Relational and Object-Oriented DBMSs allow users to invoke time-consuming ("expensive") methods in their queries. When queries containing these expensive methods are run on data with duplicate values, time is wasted redundantly computing methods on the same value. This problem has been studied in the context of programming languages, where "memoization" is the standard solution. In the database literature, sorting has been proposed to deal with this problem. We compare these approaches along with a third solution, a variant of unary hybrid hashing which we call Hybrid Cache. We demonstrate that Hybrid Cache always dominates memoization, and significantly outperforms sorting in many instances. This provides new insights into the tradeoff between hashing and sorting for unary operations. Additionally, our Hybrid Cache algorithm includes some new optimization for unary hybrid hashing, which can be used for other applications such as grouping and duplicate elimination. We conclude with a discussion of techniques for caching multiple expensive methods in a single query, and raise some new optimization problems in choosing caching techniques.

    :abstractText: The traditional focus of relational query optimization schemes has been on the choice of join methods and join orders. Restrictions have typically been handled in query optimizers by &ldquo;predicate pushdown&rdquo; rules, which apply restrictions in some random order before as many joins as possible. These rules work under the assumption that restriction is essentially a zero-time operation. However, today's extensible and object-oriented database systems allow users to define time-consuming functions, which may be used in a query's restriction and join predicates. Furthermore, SQL has long supported subquery predicates, which may be arbitrarily time-consuming to check. Thus restrictions should not be considered zero-time operations, and the model of query optimization must be enhanced. In this paper we develop a theory for moving expensive predicates in a query plan so that the total cost of the plan &mdash; including the costs of both joins and restrictions &mdash; is minimal. We present an algorithm to implement the theory, as well as results of our implementation in POSTGRES. Our experience with the newly enhanced POSTGRES query optimizer demonstrates that correctly optimizing queries with expensive predicates often produces plans that are orders of magnitude faster than plans generated by a traditional query optimizer. The additional complexity of considering expensive predicates during optimization is found to be manageably small.

    :abstractText: This paper presents general algorithms for concurrency control in tree-based access methods as well as a recovery protocol and a mechanism for ensuring repeatable read. The algorithms are developed in the context of the Generalized Search Tree (GiST) data structure, an index structure supporting an extensible set of queries and data types. Although developed in a GiST context, the algorithms are generally applicable to many tree-based access methods. The concurrency control protocol is based on an extension of the link technique originally developed for B-trees, and completely avoids holding node locks during I/Os. Repeatable read isolation is achieved with a novel combination of predicate locks and two-phase locking of data records. To our knowledge, this is the first time that isolation issues have been addressed outside the context of B-trees. A discussion of the fundamental structural differences between B-trees and more general tree structures like GiSTs explains why the algorithms developed here deviate from their B-tree counterparts. An implementation of GiSTs emulating B-trees in DB2/Common Server is underway.

    :abstractText: "The networking and distributed systems communities have recently explored a variety of new network architectures, both for application-level overlay networks, and as prototypes for a next-generation Internet architecture. In this context, we have investigated declarative networking: the use of a distributed recursive query engine as a powerful vehicle for accelerating innovation in network architectures [23, 24, 33]. Declarative networking represents a significant new application area for database research on recursive query processing. In this paper, we address fundamental database issues in this domain. First, we motivate and formally define the Network Datalog (NDlog) language for declarative network specifications. Second, we introduce and prove correct relaxed versions of the traditional semi-na\xC3\xAFve query evaluation technique, to overcome fundamental problems of the traditional technique in an asynchronous distributed setting. Third, we consider the dynamics of network state, and formalize the iheventual consistencyl. of our programs even when bursts of updates can arrive in the midst of query execution. Fourth, we present a number of query optimization opportunities that arise in the declarative networking context, including applications of traditional techniques as well as new optimizations. Last, we present evaluation results of the above ideas implemented in our P2 declarative networking system, running on 100 machines over the Emulab network testbed."

    :abstractText: We discuss the design of an acquisitional query processor for data collection in sensor networks. Acquisitional issues are those that pertain to where, when, and how often data is physically acquired (sampled) and delivered to query processing operators. By focusing on the locations and costs of acquiring data, we are able to significantly reduce power consumption over traditional passive systems that assume the a priori existence of data. We discuss simple extensions to SQL for controlling data acquisition, and show how acquisitional issues influence query optimization, dissemination, and execution. We evaluate these issues in the context of TinyDB, a distributed query processor for smart sensor devices, and show how acquisitional techniques can provide significant reductions in power consumption on our sensor devices.

    :abstractText: We present a continuously adaptive, continuous query (CACQ) implementation based on the eddy query processing framework. We show that our design provides significant performance benefits over existing approaches to evaluating continuous queries, not only because of its adaptivity, but also because of the aggressive cross-query sharing of work and space that it enables. By breaking the abstraction of shared relational algebra expressions, our Telegraph CACQ implementation is able to share physical operators --- both selections and join state --- at a very fine grain. We augment these features with a grouped-filter index to simultaneously evaluate multiple selection predicates. We include measurements of the performance of our core system, along with a comparison to existing continuous query approaches.

    :abstractText: "Traditional query processors generate full, accurate query results, either in batch or in pipelined fashion. We argue that this strict model is too rigid for exploratory queries over diverse and distributed data sources, such as sources on the Internet. Instead, we propose a looser model of querying in which a user submits a broad initial query outline, and the system continually generates partial result tuples that may contain values for only some of the output fields. The user can watch these partial results accumulate at the user interface, and accordingly refine the query by specifying their interest in different kinds of partial results.After describing our querying model and user interface, we present a query processing architecture for this model which is implemented in the Telegraph dataflow system. Our architecture is designed to generate partial results quickly, and to adapt query execution to changing user interests. The crux of this architecture is a dataflow operator that supports two kinds of reorderings: reordering of intermediate tuples within a dataflow, and reordering of query plan operators through which tuples flow. We study reordering policies that optimize for the quality of partial results delivered over time, and experimentally demonstrate the benefits of our architecture in this context."

    :abstractText: Magic sets rewriting is a well-known optimization heuristic for complex decision-support queries. There can be many variants of this rewriting even for a single query, which differ greatly in execution performance. We propose cost-based techniques for selecting an efficient variant from the many choices.Our first contribution is a practical scheme that models magic sets rewriting as a special join method that can be added to any cost-based query optimizer. We derive cost formulas that allow an optimizer to choose the best variant of the rewriting and to decide whether it is beneficial. The order of complexity of the optimization process is preserved by limiting the search space in a reasonable manner. We have implemented this technique in IBM's DB2 C/S V2 database system. Our performance measurements demonstrate that the cost-based magic optimization technique performs well, and that without it, several poor decisions could be made.Our second contribution is a formal algebraic model of magic sets rewriting, based on an extension of the multiset relational algebra, which cleanly defines the search space and can be used in a rule-based optimizer. We introduce the multiset &theta;-semijoin operator, and derive equivalence rules involving this operator. We demonstrate that magic sets rewriting for non-recursive SQL queries can be modeled as a sequential composition of these equivalence rules.

    :abstractText: We present a technique that masks failures in a cluster to provide high availability and fault-tolerance for long-running, parallelized dataflows. We can use these dataflows to implement a variety of continuous query (CQ) applications that require high-throughput, 24x7 operation. Examples include network monitoring, phone call processing, click-stream processing, and online financial analysis. Our main contribution is a scheme that carefully integrates traditional query processing techniques for partitioned parallelism with the process-pairs approach for high availability. This delicate integration allows us to tolerate failures of portions of a parallel dataflow without sacrificing result quality. Upon failure, our technique provides quick fail-over, and automatically recovers the lost pieces on the fly. This piecemeal recovery provides minimal disruption to the ongoing dataflow computation and improved reliability as compared to the straight-forward application of the process-pairs technique on a per dataflow basis. Thus, our technique provides the high availability necessary for critical CQ applications. Our techniques are encapsulated in a reusable dataflow operator called Flux, an extension of the Exchange that is used to compose parallel dataflows. Encapsulating the fault-tolerance logic into Flux minimizes modifications to existing operator code and relieves the burden on the operator writer of repeatedly implementing and verifying this critical logic. We present experiments illustrating these features with an implementation of Flux in the TelegraphCQ code base [8].

    :abstractText: We define the problem of content integration for E-Business, and show how it differs in fundamental ways from traditional issues surrounding data integration, application integration, data warehousing and OLTP. Content integration includes catalog integration as a special case, but encompasses a broader set of applications and challenges. We explore the characteristics of content integration and required services for any solution. In addition, we explore architectural alternatives and discuss the use of XML in this arena.

    :abstractText: An emerging challenge in modern distributed querying is to efficiently process multiple continuous aggregation queries simultaneously. Processing each query independently may be infeasible, so multi-query optimizations are critical for sharing work across queries. The challenge is to identify overlapping computations that may not be obvious in the queries themselves. In this paper, we reveal new opportunities for sharing work in the context of distributed aggregation queries that vary in their selection predicates. We identify settings in which a large set of q such queries can be answered by executing k . The k queries are revealed by analyzing a boolean matrix capturing the connection between data and the queries that they satisfy, in a manner akin to familiar techniques like Gaussian elimination. Indeed, we identify a class of linear aggregate functions (including SUM, COUNT and AVERAGE), and show that the sharing potential for such queries can be optimally recovered using standard matrix decompositions from computational linear algebra. For some other typical aggregation functions (including MIN and MAX) we find that optimal sharing maps to the NP-hard set basis problem. However, for those scenarios, we present a family of heuristic algorithms and demonstrate that they perform well for moderate-sized matrices. We also present a dynamic distributed system architecture to exploit sharing opportunities, and experimentally evaluate the benefits of our techniques via a novel, flexible random workload generator we develop for this setting.

    :abstractText: Many solid modeling applications require information not only about the geometry of an object but also about its topology. Most interchange formats do not provide this information, which the application must then derive as it builds its own topological data structure from unordered, &ldquo;polygon soup&rdquo; input. For very large data sets, the topological data structure itself can be bigger than core memory, so that a naive algorithm for building it that doesn't take virtual memory access patterns into account can become prohibitively slow due to thrashing. In this paper, we describe a new out-of-core algorithm that can build a topological data structure efficiently from very large data sets, improving performance by two orders of magnitude over a naive approach.

    :abstractText: Overlay networks are used today in a variety of distributed systems ranging from file-sharing and storage systems to communication infrastructures. However, designing, building and adapting these overlays to the intended application and the target environment is a difficult and time consuming process.To ease the development and the deployment of such overlay networks we have implemented P2, a system that uses a declarative logic language to express overlay networks in a highly compact and reusable form. P2 can express a Narada-style mesh network in 16 rules, and the Chord structured overlay in only 47 rules. P2 directly parses and executes such specifications using a dataflow architecture to construct and maintain overlay networks. We describe the P2 approach, how our implementation works, and show by experiment its promising trade-off point between specification complexity and performance.

    :abstractText: Applications that query data streams in order to identify trends, patterns, or anomalies can often benefit from comparing the live stream data with archived historical stream data. However, searching this historical data in real time has been considered so far to be prohibitively expensive. One of the main bottlenecks is the update costs of the indices over the archived data. In this paper, we address this problem by using our highly-efficient bitmap indexing technology (called FastBit) and demonstrate that the index update operations are sufficiently efficient for this bottleneck to be removed. We describe our prototype system based on the TelegraphCQ streaming query processor and the FastBit bitmap index. We present a detailed performance evaluation of our system using a complex query workload for analyzing real network traffic data. The combined system uses TelegraphCQ to analyze streams of traffic information and FastBit to correlate current behaviors with historical trends. We demonstrate that our system can simultaneously analyze (1) live streams with high data rates and (2) a large repository of historical stream data.

    :abstractText: The development process for access methods (AMs) in database systems is complex and tedious. Amdb is a graphical tool that facilitates the design and tuning process for height-balanced tree-structured AMs. Central to amdb's user interface is a suite of graphical views that visualize the entire search tree, paths and subtrees within the tree, and data contained in the tree. These views animate search tree operations in order to visualize the behavior of an access method. Amdb provides metrics that characterize the performance of queries, the tree structure, and the structure-shaping aspects of an AM implementation. The visualizations can be used to browse the performance metrics in the context of the tree structure. The combination of these features allows a designer to locate the sources of performance loss reported by the metrics and investigate causes for those deficiencies.

    :abstractText: Blobworld is a system for image retrieval based on finding coherent image regions which roughly correspond to objects. Each image is automatically segmented into regions ("blobs") with associated color and texture descriptors. Querying is based on the attributes of one or two regions of interest, rather than a description of the entire image. In order to make large-scale retrieval feasible, we index the blob descriptions using a tree. Because indexing in the high-dimensional feature space is computationally prohibitive, we use a lower-rank approximation to the high-dimensional distance. Experiments show encouraging results for both querying and indexing.

    :abstractText: The database and sensor network community have both recognized the utility of SQL for interfacing with sensor network systems. Recently there have been proposals to construct Internet protocols declaratively in variants of Datalog. We take these ideas to their logical extreme, and demonstrate entire distributed sensor network systems built declaratively. Our demo exposes the rapidity, flexibility, and efficiency of our approach by building several fully-functional yet widely-varying sensor network applications and services declaratively. As a result of our declarative construction, we are able to highlight a wealth of previously underexposed similarities between sensor networks and database concepts. In addition, we tackle many database systems challenges in building multiple layers of a declarative database for an embedded, distributed system.

    :abstractText: "Adaptive query processing schemes attempt to re-optimize query plans during the course of query execution. A variety of techniques for adaptive query processing have been proposed, varying in the granularity at which they can make decisions [8]. The eddy [1] is the most aggressive of these techniques, with the flexibility to choose tuple-by-tuple how to order the application of operators. In this paper we identify and address a fundamental limitation of the original eddies proposal: the burden of history in routing. We observe that routing decisions have long-term effects on the state of operators in the query, and can severely constrain the ability of the eddy to adapt over time. We then propose a mechanism we call STAIRs that allows the query engine to manipulate the state stored inside the operators and undo the effects of past routing decisions. We demonstrate that eddies with STAIRs achieve both high adaptivity and good performance in the face of uncertainty, outperforming prior eddy proposals by orders of magnitude."

    :abstractText: Declarative queries are proving to be an attractive paradigm for ineracting with networks of wireless sensors. The metaphor that "the sensornet is a database" is problematic, however, because sensors do not exhaustively represent the data in the real world. In order to map the raw sensor readings onto physical reality, a model of that reality is required to complement the readings. In this paper, we enrich interactive sensor querying with statistical modeling techniques. We demonstrate that such models can help provide answers that are both more meaningful, and, by introducing approximations with probabilistic confidences, significantly more efficient to compute in both time and energy. Utilizing the combination of a model and live data acquisition raises the challenging optimization problem of selecting the best sensor readings to acquire, balancing the increase in the confidence of our answer against the communication and data acquisition costs in the network. We describe an exponential time algorithm for finding the optimal solution to this optimization problem, and a polynomial-time heuristic for identifying solutions that perform well in practice. We evaluate our approach on several real-world sensor-network data sets, taking into account the real measured data and communication quality, demonstrating that our model-based approach provides a high-fidelity representation of the real phenomena and leads to significant performance gains versus traditional data acquisition techniques.

Yet database systems traditionally do not excel on one important scalability dimension: the degree of distribution. This limitation has hampered the impact of database technologies on massively distributed systems like the Internet. In this paper, we present the initial design of PIER, a massively distributed query engine based on overlay networks, which is intended to bring database query processing facilities to new, widely distributed environments. We motivate the need for massively distributed queries, and argue for a relaxation of certain traditional database research goals in the pursuit of scalability and widespread adoption. We present simulation results showing PIER gracefully running relational queries across thousands of machines, and show results from the same software base in actual deployment on a large experimental cluster."

    :abstractText: Sharing has emerged as a key idea of static and adaptive stream query processing systems. Inherent in these systems is a tension between sharing common work and avoiding unnecessary work. Increased sharing has generally led to more unnecessary work. Our approach of precision sharing aims to share aggressively without unnecessary work. We show why "adaptive" tuple lineage is more generally applicable and use it for precisely shared static dataflows. We also show how "static" ordering constraints can be used for precision sharing in adaptive systems. Finally, we report an experimental study of precision sharing.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we address the problem of designing a scalable, accurate query processor for peer-to-peer filesharing and similar distributed keyword search systems. Using a globally-distributed monitoring infrastructure, we perform an extensive study of the Gnutella filesharing network, characterizing its topology, data and query workloads. We observe that Gnutella's query processing approach performs well for popular content, but quite poorly for rare items with few replicas. We then consider an alternate approach based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). We describe our implementation of PIERSearch, a DHT-based system, and propose a hybrid system where Gnutella is used to locate popular items, and PIERSearch for handling rare items. We develop an analytical model of the two approaches, and use it in concert with our Gnutella traces to study the trade-off between query recall and system overhead of the hybrid system. We evaluate a variety of localized schemes for identifying items that are rare and worth handling via the DHT. Lastly, we show in a live deployment on fifty nodes on two continents that it nicely complements Gnutella in its ability to handle rare items.

    :abstractText: We present a pipelining, dynamically user-controllable reorder operator, for use in data-intensive applications. Allowing the user to reorder the data delivery on the fly increases the interactivity in several contexts such as online aggregation and large-scale spreadsheets; it allows the user to control the processing of data by dynamically specifying preferences for different data items based on prior feedback, so that data of interest is prioritized for early processing. In this paper we describe an efficient, non-blocking mechanism for reordering, which can be used over arbitrary data streams from files, indexes, and continuous data feeds. We also investigate several policies for the reordering based on the performance goals of various typical applications. We present results from an implementation used in Online Aggregation in the Informix Dynamic Server with Universal Data Option, and in sorting and scrolling in a large-scale spreadsheet. Our experiments demonstrate that for a variety of data distributions and applications, reordering is responsive to dynamic preference changes, imposes minimal overheads in overall completion time, and provides dramatic improvements in the quality of the feedback over time. Surprisingly, preliminary experiments indicate that online reordering can also be useful in traditional batch query processing, because it can serve as a form of pipelined, approximate sorting.

    :abstractText: Distributed monitoring applications often involve streams of unique identifiers (UIDs) such as IP addresses or RFID tag IDs. An important class of query for such applications involves partitioning the UIDs into groups using a large lookup table; the query then performs aggregation over the groups. We propose using histograms to reduce bandwidth utilization in such settings, using a histogram partitioning function as a compact representation of the lookup table. We investigate methods for constructing histogram partitioning functions for lookup tables over unique identifiers that form a hierarchy of contiguous groups, as is the case with network addresses and several other types of UID. Each bucket in our histograms corresponds to a subtree of the hierarchy. We develop three novel classes of partitioning functions for this domain, which vary in their structure, construction time, and estimation accuracy.Our approach provides several advantages over previous work. We show that optimal instances of our partitioning functions can be constructed efficiently from large lookup tables. The partitioning functions are also compact, with each partition represented by a single identifier. Finally, our algorithms support minimizing any error metric that can be expressed as a distributive aggregate; and they extend naturally to multiple hierarchical dimensions. In experiments on real-world network monitoring data, we show that our histograms provide significantly higher accuracy per bit than existing techniques.

    :abstractText: "We consider the in-network computation of approximate \"big picture\" summaries in bandwidth-constrained sensor networks. First we review early work on computing the Haar wavelet decomposition as a User-Defined Aggregate in a sensor query engine. We argue that this technique can be significantly improved by choosing a function-specific network topology. We generalize this discussion to a loose definition of a 2-level optimization problem that maps from a function to what we call a support graph for the function, and from there to an aggregation tree that is chosen from possible subgraphs of the physical network connectivity. This work is frankly quite preliminary: we raise a number of questions but provide relatively few answers. The intent of the paper is to lay groundwork for discussion and further research."

    :abstractText: "Recent research has proposed efficient protocols for distributed triggers, which can be used in monitoring infrastructures to maintain system-wide invariants and detect abnormal events with minimal communication overhead. To date, however, this work has been limited to simple thresholds on distributed aggregate functions like sums and counts. In this paper, we present our initial results that show how to use these simple threshold triggers to enable sophisticated anomaly detection in near-real time, with modest communication overheads. We design a distributed protocol to detect \"unusual traffic patterns\" buried in an Origin-Destination network flow matrix that: a) uses a Principal Components Analysis decomposition technique to detect anomalies via a threshold function on residual signals [10]; and b) efficiently tracks this threshold function in near-real time using a simple distributed protocol. In addition, we speculate that such simple thresholding can be a powerful tool for a variety of monitoring tasks beyond the one presented here, and we propose an agenda to explore additional sophisticated applications."

    :abstractText: Data analysis is fundamentally an iterative process in which you issue a query, receive a response, formulate the next query based on the response, and repeat. You usually don't issue a single, perfectly chosen query and get the information you want from a database; indeed, the purpose of data analysis is to extract unknown information, and in most situations, there is no one perfect query. People naturally start by asking broad, big-picture questions and then continually refine their questions based on feedback and domain knowledge. In the Control (Continuous Output and Navigation Technology with Refinement Online) project at the University of California, Berkeley, the authors are working with collaborators at IBM, Informix, and elsewhere to explore ways to improve human-computer interaction during data analysis. The Control project's goal is to develop interactive, intuitive techniques for analyzing massive data sets.

    :abstractText: The database research community is rightly proud of success in basic research, and its remarkable record of technology transfer. Now the field needs to radically broaden its research focus to attack the issues of capturing, storing, analyzing, and presenting the vast array of online data. The database research community should embrace a broader research agenda &mdash; broadening the definition of database management to embrace all the content of the Web and other online data stores, and rethinking our fundamental assumptions in light of technology shifts. To accelerate this transition, we recommend changing the way research results are evaluated and presented. In particular, we advocate encouraging more speculative and long-range work, moving conferences to a poster format, and publishing all research literature on the Web.

    :abstractText: "We develop a theoretical framework to characterize the hardness of indexing data sets on block-access memory devices like hard disks. We define an indexing workload by a data set and a set of potential queries. For a workload, we can construct an indexing scheme, which is a collection of fixed-sized subsets of the data. We identify two measures of efficiency for an indexing scheme on a workload: storage redundancy, r (how many times each item in the data set is stored), and access overhead, A (how many times more blocks than necessary does a query retrieve).For many interesting families of workloads, there exists a trade-off between storage redundancy and access overhead. Given a desired access overhead A, there is a minimum redundancy that any indexing scheme must exhibit. We prove a lower-bound theorem for deriving the minimum redundancy. By applying this theorem, we show interesting upper and lower bounds and trade-offs between A and r in the case of multidimensional range queries and set queries."

    :abstractText: "A number of researchers have become interested in the design of global-scale networked systems and applications. Our thesis here is that the database community's principles and technologies have an important role to play in the design of these systems. The point of departure is at the roots of database research: we generalize Codd's notion of data independence to physical environments beyond storage systems. We note analogies between the development of database indexes and the new generation of structured peer-to-peer networks. We illustrate the emergence of data independence in networks by surveying a number of recent network facilities and applications, seen through a database lens. We present a sampling of database query processing techniques that can contribute in this arena, and discuss methods for adoption of these technologies."

    :abstractText: Though physical sensing instruments have long been used in astronomy, biology, and civil engineering, the recent emergence of wireless sensor networks and RFID has spurred a renaissance in sensor interest in both academia and industry. In this paper, we examine the spectrum of sensing platforms, from billion dollar satellites to tiny RF tags, and discuss the technological differences between them. We show that battery powered sensor networks, with low-power multihop radios and low-cost processors, occupy a sweet spot in this spectrum that is rife with opportunity for novel database research. We briefly summarize some of our research work in this space and present a number of examples of interesting sensor network-related problems that the database community is uniquely equipped to address.

    :abstractText: Decision support systems (DSS) and data warehousing workloads comprise an increasing fraction of the database market today. I/O capacity and associated processing requirements for DSS workloads are increasing at a rapid rate, doubling roughly every nine to twelve months [38]. In response to this increasing storage and computational demand, we present a computer architecture for decision support database servers that utilizes &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; disks (IDISKs). IDISKs utilize low-cost embedded general-purpose processing, main memory, and high-speed serial communication links on each disk. IDISKs are connected to each other via these serial links and high-speed crossbar switches, overcoming the I/O bus bottleneck of conventional systems. By off-loading computation from expensive desktop processors, IDISK systems may improve cost-performance. More importantly, the IDISK architecture allows the processing of the system to scale with increasing storage demand.

    :abstractText: This article gives methods for statically analyzing sets of active database rules to determine if the rules are (1) guaranteed to terminate, (2) guaranteed to produce a unique final database state, and (3) guaranteed to produce a unique stream of observable actions. If the analysis determines that one of these properties is not guaranteed, it isolates the rules responsible for the problem and determines criteria that, if satisfied, guarantee the property. The analysis methods are presented in the context of the Starburst Rule System.

    :abstractText: Object-relational database management systems allow knowledgeable users to define new data types as well as new methods (operators) for the types. This flexibility produces an attendant complexity, which must be handled in new ways for an object-relational database management system to be efficient. In this article we study techniques for optimizing queries that contain time-consuming methods. The focus of traditional query optimizers has been on the choice of join methods and orders; selections have been handled by &ldquo;pushdown&rdquo; rules. These rules apply selections in an arbitrary order before as many joins as possible, using th e assumption that selection takes no time. However, users of object-relational systems can embed complex methods in selections. Thus selections may take significant amounts of time, and the query optimization model must be enhanced. In this article we carefully define a query cost framework that incorporates both selectivity and cost estimates for selections. We develop an algorithm called Predicate Migration, and prove that it produces optimal plans for queries with expensive methods. We then describe our implementation of Predicate Migration in the commercial object-relational database management system Illustra, and discuss practical issues that affect our earlier assumptions. We compare Predicate Migration to a variety of simplier optimization techniques, and demonstrate that Predicate Migration is the best general solution to date. The alternative techniques we present may be useful for constrained workloads.

    :abstractText: We discuss the design of an acquisitional query processor for data collection in sensor networks. Acquisitional issues are those that pertain to where, when, and how often data is physically acquired (sampled) and delivered to query processing operators. By focusing on the locations and costs of acquiring data, we are able to significantly reduce power consumption over traditional passive systems that assume the a priori existence of data. We discuss simple extensions to SQL for controlling data acquisition, and show how acquisitional issues influence query optimization, dissemination, and execution. We evaluate these issues in the context of TinyDB, a distributed query processor for smart sensor devices, and show how acquisitional techniques can provide significant reductions in power consumption on our sensor devices.

    :abstractText: We present a pipelining, dynamically tunable reorder operator for providing user control during long running, data- intensive operations. Users can see partial results and accordingly direct the processing by specifying preferences for various data items; data of interest is prioritized for early processing. The reordering mechanism is efficient and non-blocking and can be used over arbitrary data streams from files and indexes, as well as continuous data feeds. We also investigate several policies for the reordering based on the performance goals of various typical applications. We present performance results for reordering in the context of an online aggregation implementation in Informix and in the context of sorting and scrolling in a large-scale spreadsheet. Our experiments demonstrate that for a variety of data distributions and applications, reordering is responsive to dynamic preference changes, imposes minimal overheads in overall completion time, and provides dramatic improvements in the quality of the feedback over time. Surprisingly, preliminary experiments indicate that online reordering can also be useful in traditional batch query processing, because it can serve as a form of pipelined, approximate sorting.

    :abstractText: Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are a ubiquitous and critical component of modern computing, and the result of decades of research and development in both academia and industry. Architecture of a Database System presents an architectural discussion of DBMS design principles, including process models, parallel architecture, storage system design, transaction system implementation, query processor and optimizer architectures, and typical shared components and utilities. Successful commercial and open-source systems are used as points of reference, particularly when multiple alternative designs have been adopted by different groups. Historically, DBMSs were among the earliest multi-user server systems to be developed, and thus pioneered many systems design techniques for scalability and reliability now in use in many other contexts. While many of the algorithms and abstractions used by a DBMS are textbook material, Architecture of a Database System addresses the systems design issues that make a DBMS work. Architecture of a Database System is an invaluable reference for database researchers and practitioners and for those in other areas of computing interested in the systems design techniques for scalability and reliability that originated in DBMS research and development.

    :abstractText: "Declarative languages have recently been proposed for many new applications outside of traditional data management. Since these are relatively early research efforts, it is important that the architectures of these declarative systems be extensible, in order to accommodate unforeseen needs in these new domains. In this paper, we apply the lessons of declarative systems to the internals of a declarative engine. Specifically, we describe our design and implementation of Evita Raced, an extensible compiler for the OverLog language used in our declarative networking system, P2. Evita Raced is a metacompiler: an OverLog compiler written in OverLog. We describe the minimalist architecture of Evita Raced, including its extensibility interfaces and its reuse of P2's data model and runtime engine. We demonstrate that a declarative language like OverLog is well-suited to expressing traditional and novel query optimizations as well as other query manipulations, in a compact and natural fashion. Finally, we present initial results of Evita Raced extended with various optimization programs, running on both Internet overlay networks and wireless sensor networks."

    :abstractText: "Several real-world applications need to effectively manage and reason about large amounts of data that are inherently uncertain. For instance, pervasive computing applications must constantly reason about volumes of noisy sensory readings for a variety of reasons, including motion prediction and human behavior modeling. Such probabilistic data analyses require sophisticated machine-learning tools that can effectively model the complex spatio/temporal correlation patterns present in uncertain sensory data. Unfortunately, to date, most existing approaches to probabilistic database systems have relied on somewhat simplistic models of uncertainty that can be easily mapped onto existing relational architectures: Probabilistic information is typically associated with individual data tuples, with only limited or no support for effectively capturing and reasoning about complex data correlations. In this paper, we introduce BayesStore, a novel probabilistic data management architecture built on the principle of handling statistical models and probabilistic inference tools as first-class citizens of the database system. Adopting a machine-learning view, BAYESSTORE employs concise statistical relational models to effectively encode the correlation patterns between uncertain data, and promotes probabilistic inference and statistical model manipulation as part of the standard DBMS operator repertoire to support efficient and sound query processing. We present BAYESSTORE's uncertainty model based on a novel, first-order statistical model, and we redefine traditional query processing operators, to manipulate the data and the probabilistic models of the database in an efficient manner. Finally, we validate our approach, by demonstrating the value of exploiting data correlations during query processing, and by evaluating a number of optimizations which significantly accelerate query processing."

    :abstractText: Query optimization is the most computationally complex task in a database management systems. In many query optimizers, faster CPUs and increased RAM can translate directly to better query plans and thus better overall system performance. Although memory size continues to scale with Moore's Law, processor speeds are leveling off. Chip manufacturers are now focusing on multicore designs that integrate increasing numbers of cores in a single CPU. Query optimizers need to be parallelized in order to continue enjoying the growth trend of Moore's Law. In this paper, we address this problem in the context of the extensible optimizer architectures found in many commercial database systems. We identify the key data dependencies inherent in the dynamic programming at the heart of these optimizers. We use this insight both to design a flexible parallel query optimization implementation, and to assess the opportunities for parallelism in this context. The proposed solutions can serve as a blueprint for retrofitting existing industry-grade optimizers to leverage multicore architectures, without requiring significant rework of the underlying infrastructure.

    :abstractText: As massive data acquisition and storage becomes increasingly affordable, a wide variety of enterprises are employing statisticians to engage in sophisticated data analysis. In this paper we highlight the emerging practice of Magnetic, Agile, Deep (MAD) data analysis as a radical departure from traditional Enterprise Data Warehouses and Business Intelligence. We present our design philosophy, techniques and experience providing MAD analytics for one of the world's largest advertising networks at Fox Audience Network, using the Greenplum parallel database system. We describe database design methodologies that support the agile working style of analysts in these settings. We present dataparallel algorithms for sophisticated statistical techniques, with a focus on density methods. Finally, we reflect on database system features that enable agile design and flexible algorithm development using both SQL and MapReduce interfaces over a variety of storage mechanisms.

    :abstractText: Declarative Networking is a programming methodology that enables developers to concisely specify network protocols and services, which are directly compiled to a dataflow framework that executes the specifications. This paper provides an introduction to basic issues in declarative networking, including language design, optimization, and dataflow execution. We present the intuition behind declarative programming of networks, including roots in Datalog, extensions for networked environments, and the semantics of long-running queries over network state. We focus on a sublanguage we call Network Datalog (NDlog), including execution strategies that provide crisp eventual consistency semantics with significant flexibility in execution. We also describe a more general language called Overlog, which makes some compromises between expressive richness and semantic guarantees. We provide an overview of declarative network protocols, with a focus on routing protocols and overlay networks. Finally, we highlight related work in declarative networking, and new declarative approaches to related problems.

    :abstractText: The Paxos consensus protocol can be specified concisely, but is notoriously difficult to implement in practice. We recount our experience building Paxos in Overlog, a distributed declarative programming language. We found that the Paxos algorithm is easily translated to declarative logic, in large part because the primitives used in consensus protocol specifications map directly to simple Overlog constructs such as aggregation and selection. We discuss the programming idioms that appear frequently in our implementation, and the applicability of declarative programming to related application domains.

    :abstractText: "In this work we present new in-network techniques for communication efficient approximate query processing in wireless sensornets. We use a model-based approach that constructs and maintains a spanning tree within the network, rooted at the basestation. The tree maintains compressed summary information for each link that is used to \xE2\x80\x9Cstub out\xE2\x80\x9D traversal during query processing. Our work is based on a formal model of the in-network tree construction task framed as an optimization problem.We demonstrate hardness results for that problem, and develop efficient approximation algorithms for subtasks that are too expensive to compute exactly. We also propose efficient heuristics to accommodate a wider set of workloads, and empirically evaluate their performance and sensitivity to model changes."

    :abstractText: As the diversity of sensornet use cases increases, the combinations of environments and applications that will coexist will make custom engineering increasingly impractical. We investigate an approach that focuses on replacing custom engineering with automated optimization of declarative protocol specifications. Specifically, we automate network rendezvous and proxy selection from program source. These optimizations perform program transformations that are grounded in recursive query optimization, an area of database theory. Our prototype system implementation can automatically choose program executions that are as much as three, and usually one order of magnitude better than original source programs.

    :abstractText: MapReduce is a popular framework for data-intensive distributed computing of batch jobs. To simplify fault tolerance, many implementations of MapReduce materialize the entire output of each map and reduce task before it can be consumed. In this paper, we propose a modified MapReduce architecture that allows data to be pipelined between operators. This extends the MapReduce programming model beyond batch processing, and can reduce completion times and improve system utilization for batch jobs as well. We present a modified version of the Hadoop MapReduce framework that supports online aggregation, which allows users to see "early returns" from a job as it is being computed. Our Hadoop Online Prototype (HOP) also supports continuous queries, which enable MapReduce programs to be written for applications such as event monitoring and stream processing. HOP retains the fault tolerance properties of Hadoop and can run unmodified user-defined MapReduce programs.

    :abstractText: "There is growing urgency in computer science circles regarding an impending crisis in parallel programming. Emerging computing platforms, from multicore processors to cloud computing, predicate their performance growth on the development of software to harness parallelism. For the first time in the history of computing, the progress of Moore's Law depends on the productivity of software engineers. Unfortunately, parallel and distributed programming today is challenging even for the best programmers, and simply unworkable for the majority. There has never been a more urgent need for breakthroughs in programming models and languages. While parallel programming in general is considered very difficult, data parallelism has been very successful. The relational algebra parallelizes easily over large datasets, and SQL programmers have long reaped the benefits of parallelism without modifications to their code. This point has been rediscovered and amplified via recent enthusiasm for MapReduce programming and \"Big Data\", which have turned data parallelism into common culture across computing. As a result, it is increasingly attractive to tackle the challenge of parallel programming on the firm common ground of data parallelism: start with an easy-to-parallelize kernel-relational algebra-and extend it to general-purpose computation. This approach has clear precedents in database theory, where it has long been known that classical relational languages have natural Turing-complete extensions. At the same time that this crisis has been evolving, variants of Datalog have been seen cropping up in a wide range of practical settings, from security to robotics to compiler analysis. Over the past seven years, we have been exploring the use of Datalog-inspired languages in a variety of systems projects, with a focus on inherently parallel tasks in networking and distributed systems. The experience has been largely positive: we have demonstrated full-featured Datalog-based system implementations that are orders of magnitude more compact than equivalent imperatively-implemented systems, with competitive performance and significantly accelerated software evolution. Evidence is mounting that Datalog can serve as the basis of a much simpler family of languages for programming serious parallel and distributed software. This raises many questions that should warm the heart of a database theoretician. How does the complexity hierarchy of logic languages relate to parallel models of computation? Is there a suitable Coordination Complexity model that captures the realities of modern parallel hardware, where computation is cheap and coordination is expensive? Can the lens of logic provide better focus on what is \"hard\" to parallelize, what is \"embarrassingly parallel\", and points in between? Does our understanding of non-monotonic reasoning shed light on the ability of loosely-coupled distributed systems to guarantee eventual consistency? And finally, a question close to the heart of the PODS conference: if Datalog has been The Answer all these years, is parallel and distributed programming The Question it has been waiting for? In this talk and the paper that accompanies it, I present design patterns that arose in our experience building distributed and parallel software in the style of Datalog, and use them to motivate some initial conjectures relating to the questions above. The full paper was not available at the time these proceedings were printed, but can be found online by searching for the phrase \"Springtime for Datalog\"."

    :abstractText: Building and debugging distributed software remains extremely difficult. We conjecture that by adopting a data-centric approach to system design and by employing declarative programming languages, a broad range of distributed software can be recast naturally in a data-parallel programming model. Our hope is that this model can significantly raise the level of abstraction for programmers, improving code simplicity, speed of development, ease of software evolution, and program correctness. This paper presents our experience with an initial large-scale experiment in this direction. First, we used the Overlog language to implement a "Big Data" analytics stack that is API-compatible with Hadoop and HDFS and provides comparable performance. Second, we extended the system with complex distributed features not yet available in Hadoop, including high availability, scalability, and unique monitoring and debugging facilities. We present both quantitative and anecdotal results from our experience, providing some concrete evidence that both data-centric design and declarative languages can substantially simplify distributed systems programming.

    :abstractText: Reasoning about stochastic dynamical systems and planning under uncertainty has come to play a fundamental role in AI research and applications. The representation of such systems, in particular, of actions with stochastic effects, has accordingly been given increasing attention in recent years. In this article, we survey a number of techniques for representing stochastic processes and actions with stochastic effects using dynamic Bayesian networks and influence diagrams, and briefly describe how these support effective inference for tasks such as monitoring, forecasting, explanation and decision making. We also compare these techniques to several action representations adopted in the classical reasoning about action and planning communities, describing how traditional problems such as the frame and ramification problems are dealt with in stochastic settings, and how these solutions compare to recent approaches to this problem in the classical (deterministic) literature. We argue that while stochastic dynamics introduce certain complications when it comes to such issues, for the most part, intuitions underlying classical models can be extended to the stochastic setting.

    :abstractText: Preference elicitation is a key problem facing the deployment of intelligent systems that make or recommend decisions on the behalf of users. Since not all aspects of a utility function have the same impact on object-level decision quality, determining which information to extract from a user is itself a sequential decision problem, balancing the amount of elicitation effort and time with decision quality. We formulate this problem as a partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Because of the continuous nature of the state and action spaces of this POMDP, standard techniques cannot be used to solve it. We describe methods that exploit the special structure of preference elicitation to deal with parameterized belief states over the continuous state space, and gradient techniques for optimizing parameterized actions. These methods can be used with a number of different belief state representations, including mixture models.

    :abstractText: Combinatorial auctions provide a valuable mechanism for the allocation of goods in settings where buyer valuations exhibit complex structure with respect to substitutability and complementarity. Most algorithms are designed to work with explicit "flat" bids for concrete bundles of goods. However, logical bidding languages allow the expression of complex utility functions in a natural and concise way, and have recently attracted considerable attention. Despite the power of logical languages, no current winner determination algorithms exploit the specific structure of logically specified bids to solve problems more effectively. In this paper, we describe techniques to do just this. Specifically, we propose a direct integer program (IP) formulation of the winner determination problem for bids in the <i>L<inf>GB</inf></i> logical language. This formulation is linear in the size of the problem and can be solved effectively using standard optimization packages. We compare this formulation and its solution time to those of the corresponding set of flat bids, demonstrating the immense utility of exploiting the structure of logically expressed bids. We also consider an extension of <i>L<inf>GB</inf></i> and show that these can also be solved using linear constraints.

    :abstractText: Recent algorithms provide powerful solutions to the problem of determining cost-minimizing (or revenue-maximizing) allocations of items in combinatorial auctions. However, in many settings, criteria other than cost (e.g., the number of winners, the delivery date of items, etc.) are also relevant in judging the quality of an allocation. Furthermore, the bid taker is usually uncertain about her preferences regarding tradeoffs between cost and nonprice features. We describe new methods that allow the bid taker to determine (approximately) optimal allocations despite this. These methods rely on the notion of minimax regret to guide the elicitation of preferences from the bid taker and to measure the quality of an allocation in the presence of utility function uncertainty. Computational experiments demonstrate the practicality of minimax computation and the efficacy of our elicitation techniques.

    :abstractText: The search for finite-state controllers for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is often based on approaches like gradient ascent, attractive because of their relatively low computational cost. In this paper, we illustrate a basic problem with gradient-based methods applied to POMDPs, where the sequential nature of the decision problem is at issue, and propose a new stochastic local search method as an alternative. The heuristics used in our procedure mimic the sequential reasoning inherent in optimal dynamic programming (DP) approaches. We show that our algorithm consistently finds higher quality controllers than gradient ascent, and is competitive with (and, for some problems, superior to) other state-of-the-art controller and DP-based algorithms on large-scale POMDPs.

    :abstractText: "Any automated decision support software must tailor its actions or recommendations to the preferences of different users. Thus it requires some representation of user preferences as well as a means of eliciting or otherwise learning the preferences of the specific user on whose behalf it is acting. While additive preference models offer a compact representation of multiattribute utility functions, and ease of elicitation, they are often overly restrictive. The more flexible generalized additive independence (GAI) model maintains much of the intuitive nature of additive models, but comes at the cost of much more complex elicitation. In this article, we summarize the key contributions of our earlier paper (UAI 2005): (a) the first elaboration of the semantic foundations of GAI models that allows one to engage in preference elicitation using local queries over small subsets of attributes rather than global queries over full outcomes; and (b) specific procedures for Bayesian preference elicitation of the parameters of a GAI model using such local queries."

    :abstractText: Classic direct mechanisms suffer from the drawback of requiring full type (or utility function) revelation from participating agents. In complex settings with multi-attribute utility, assessing utility functions can be very difficult, a problem addressed by recent work on preference elicitation. In this work we propose a framework for incremental, partial revelation mechanisms and study the use of minimax regret as an optimization criterion for allocation determination with type uncertainty. We examine the incentive properties of incremental mechanisms when minimax regret is used to determine allocations with no additional elicitation of payment information, and when additional payment information is obtained. We argue that elicitation effort can be focused simultaneously on reducing allocation and payment uncertainty.

    :abstractText: Autonomic (self-managing) computing systems face the critical problem of resource allocation to different computing elements. Adopting a recent model, we view the problem of provisioning resources as involving utility elicitation and optimization to allocate resources given imprecise utility information. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for regret-based optimization that performs significantly faster than that proposed in earlier work. We also explore new regret-based elicitation heuristics that are able to find near-optimal allocations while requiring a very small amount of utility information from the distributed computing elements. Since regret-computation is intensive, we compare these to the more tractable Nelder-Mead optimization technique w.r.t. amount of utility information required.

Current research has adopted linear programming as an effective means to calculate approximations for a <i>given</i> set of basis functions, tackling very large MDPs as a result. However, a number of issues remain unresolved: <i>How accurate are the approximations produced by linear programs? How hard is it to produce better approximations? </i> and <i>Where do the basis functions come from?</i> To address these questions, we first investigate the complexity of minimizing the Bellman error of a linear value function approximation--showing that this is an inherently hard problem. Nevertheless, we provide a branch and bound method for calculating Bellman error and performing approximate policy iteration for general factored MDPs. These methods are more accurate than linear programming, but more expensive. We then consider linear programming itself and investigate methods for automatically constructing sets of basis functions that allow this approach to produce good approximations. The techniques we develop are guaranteed to reduce <i>L</i><inf>1</inf> error, but can also empirically reduce Bellman error."

    :abstractText: A number of proposals have been put forth in recent years for the solution of Markov decision processes (MDPs) whose state (and sometimes action) spaces are factored. One recent class of methods involves linear value function approximation, where the optimal value function is assumed to be a linear combination of some set of basis functions, with the aim of finding suitable weights. While sophisticated techniques have been developed for finding the best approximation within this constrained space, few methods have been proposed for choosing a suitable basis set, or modifying it if solution quality is found wanting. We propose a general framework, and specific proposals, that address both of these questions. In particular, we examine <i>weakly coupled MDPs</i> where a number of subtasks can be viewed independently modulo resource constraints. We then describe methods for constructing a piecewise linear combination of the subtask value functions, using greedy decision tree techniques. We argue that this architecture is suitable for many types of MDPs whose combinatorics are determined largely by the existence multiple conflicting objectives.

    :abstractText: In most mechanism design settings, optimal general-purpose mechanisms are not known. Thus the automated design of mechanisms tailored to specific instances of a decision scenario is an important problem. Existing techniques for automated mechanism design (AMD) require the revelation of full utility information from agents, which can be very difficult in practice. In this work, we study the automated design of mechanisms that only require partial revelation of utilities. Each agent's type space is partitioned into a finite set of partial types, and agents (should) report the partial type within which their full type lies. We provide a set of optimization routines that can be combined to address the trade-offs between the amount of communication, approximation of incentive properties, and objective value achieved by a mechanism. This allows for the automated design of partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on incentive properties for any objective function (revenue, social welfare, etc.).

    :abstractText: "Various tasks in decision making and decision support require selecting a preferred subset of items from a given set of feasible items. Recent work in this area considered methods for specifying such preferences based on the attribute values of individual elements within the set. Of these, the approach of (Brafman et al. 2006) appears to be the most general. In this paper, we consider the problem of computing an optimal subset given such a specification. The problem is shown to be NP-hard in the general case, necessitating heuristic search methods. We consider two algorithm classes for this problem: direct set construction, and implicit enumeration as solutions to appropriate CSPs. New algorithms are presented in each class and compared empirically against previous results."

We describe a general model of expressive ad contract/bidding and an allocation model that can be executed in real time through the assignment of fractions of relevant ad channels to specific advertiser contracts. The uncertainty in channel supply and demand is addresscd by the formulation of a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem for channel allocation that is rerun periodically. We solve this in two different ways: fast deterministic optimization with respect to expectations; and a novel online sample-based stochastic optimization method-- that can be applied to continuous decision spaces--which exploits the deterministic optimization as a black box. Experiments demonstrate the importance of expressive bidding and the value of stochastic optimization."

    :abstractText: Much emphasis in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) research is placed on ensuring that MARL algorithms (eventually) converge to desirable equilibria. As in standard reinforcement learning, convergence generally requires sufficient exploration of strategy space. However, exploration often comes at a price in the form of penalties or foregone opportunities. In multiagent settings, the problem is exacerbated by the need for agents to "coordinate" their policies on equilibria. We propose a Bayesian model for optimal exploration in MARL problems that allows these exploration costs to be weighed against their expected benefits using the notion of value of information. Unlike standard RL models, this model requires reasoning about how one's actions will influence the behavior of other agents. We develop tractable approximations to optimal Bayesian exploration, and report on experiments illustrating the benefits of this approach in identical interest games.

    :abstractText: Research on coalition formation usually assumes the values of potential coalitions to be known with certainty. Furthermore, settings in which agents lack sufficient knowledge of the capabilities of potential partners is rarely, if ever, touched upon. We remove these often unrealistic assumptions and propose a model that utilizes Bayesian (multiagent) reinforcement learning in a way that enables coalition participants to reduce their uncertainty regarding coalitional values and the capabilities of others. In addition, we introduce the Bayesian Core, a new stability concept for coalition formation under uncertainty. Preliminary experimental evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

    :abstractText: Coalition formation is a problem of great interest in AI, allowing groups of autonomous, rational agents to form stable teams. Furthermore, the study of coalitional stability concepts and their relation to equilibria that guide the strategic interactions of agents during bargaining has lately attracted much attention. However, research to date in both AI and economics has largely ignored the potential presence of uncertainty when studying either coalitional stability or coalitional bargaining. This paper is the first to relate a (cooperative) stability concept under uncertainty, the Bayesian core (BC), with (non-cooperative) equilibrium concepts of coalitional bargaining games. We prove that if the BC of a coalitional game (and of each subgame) is non-empty, then there exists an equilibrium of the corresponding bargaining game that produces a BC element; and conversely, if there exists a coalitional bargaining equilibrium (with certain properties), then it induces a BC configuration. We thus provide a non-cooperative justification of the BC stability concept. As a corollary, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of the BC. Finally, for small games, we provide an algorithm to decide whether the BC is non-empty.

    :abstractText: "The problem of coalition formation when agents are uncertain about the types or capabilities of their potential partners is a critical one. In [3] a Bayesian reinforcement learning framework is developed for this problem when coalitions are formed (and tasks undertaken) repeatedly: not only does the model allow agents to refine their beliefs about the types of others, but uses value of information to define optimal exploration policies. However, computational approximations in that work are purely myopic. We present novel, non-myopic learning algorithms to approximate the optimal Bayesian solution, providing tractable means to ensure good sequential performance. We evaluate our algorithms in a variety of settings, and show that one, in particular, exhibits consistently good sequential performance. Further, it enables the Bayesian agents to transfer acquired knowledge among different dynamic tasks."

    :abstractText: The development of intelligent assistants has largely benefited from the adoption of decision-theoretic (DT) approaches that enable an agent to reason and account for the uncertain nature of user behaviour in a complex software domain. At the same time, most intelligent assistants fail to consider the numerous factors relevant from a human-computer interaction perspective. While DT approaches offer a sound foundation for designing intelligent agents, these systems need to be equipped with an interaction cost model in order to reason the impact of how (static or adaptive) interaction is perceived by different users. In a DT framework, we formalize four common interaction factors --- information processing, savings, visual occlusion, and bloat. We empirically derive models for bloat and occlusion based on the results of two users experiments. These factors are incorporated in a simulated help assistant where decisions are modeled as a Markov decision process. Our simulation results reveal that our model can easily adapt to a wide range of user types with varying preferences.

    :abstractText: Cognitive assistive technologies that aid people with dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) hold the promise to provide such people with an increased level of independence. However, to realize this promise, such systems must account for the specific needs and preferences of individuals. We argue that this form of customization requires a sequential, decision-theoretic model of interaction. We describe both fully and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models of a handwashing task, and show that, despite the potential computational complexity, these can be effectively solved and produce policies that are evaluated as useful by professional caregivers.

    :abstractText: Intelligent agents often need to assess user utility functions in order to make decisions on their behalf, or predict their behavior. When uncertainty exists over the precise nature of this utility function, one can model this uncertainty using a distribution over utility functions. This view lies at the core of games with incomplete information and, more recently, several proposals for incremental preference elicitation. In such cases, decisions (or predicted behavior) are based on computing the expected expected utility (EEU) of decisions with respect to the distribution over utility functions. Unfortunately, decisions made under EEU are sensitive to the precise representation of the utility function. We examine the conditions under which EEU provides for sensible decisions by appeal to the foundational axioms of decision theory. We also discuss the impact these conditions have on the enterprise of preference elicitation more broadly.

    :abstractText: Inheritance reasoning has frequently been characterized by algorithms designed to operate on inheritance networks, or collections of links. While the intended meaning of links in a network is understood, formal semantic accounts of such networks are somewhat troublesome, as are semantic accounts of the inference process. We suggest that links be interpreted as sentences in the conditional logic E, providing a formal interpretation for such networks. Furthermore, we develop a semantic characterization of inheritance reasoning based on the technique of minimal (or preferred) models. In the process, we identify a key difference between this characterization of inference in networks and those based on the notion of inferential distance, specifically with respect to stability.

    :abstractText: Recently, the relationship between several forms of default reasoning based on conditional defaults has been investigated, In particular, the systems based on e-semantics, preferential models and (fragments of) modally-defined conditional logics have been shown to be equivalent. These systems form a plausible core for default inference, but are too weak in general, failing to deal adequately with irrelevance. We propose an extension of the (modal) conditional logics in which one can express the truth of sentences at inaccessible possible worlds and show how this logic can be used to axiomatize a simple preference relation on the modal structures of this logic. This preferential semantics is shown to be equivalent to 1-entailment and rational closure. We suggest that many metalogical systems of default inference can be axiomatized within this logic, using the notion of inaccessible worlds.

    :abstractText: The truth conditions for conditional sentences have been well-studied, but few compelling attempts have been made to define means of evaluating iterated or nested conditionals. In particular, most approaches impose very few constraints on the set of conditionals an agent can hold after revision of its belief set. In this paper we describe the method of natural revision that ensures the preservation of conditional beliefs after revision by an objective belief. Our model, based on a simple modal logic for beliefs and conditionals, extends the AGM theory of belief revision to account for sentences of objective revisions of a belief set. This model of revision ensures that an agent makes as few changes as possible to the conditional component of its belief set. Adopting the Ramsey test, natural revision provides truth conditions for arbitrary right-nested conditionals. We show that the problem of determining acceptance of any such nested conditional can be reduced to acceptance tests for unnested conditionals, indicating that iterated revision can be simulated by virtual updates. We also briefly describe certain reductions to (sometimes tractable) propositional inference, and other informational properties.

    :abstractText: Belief revision and belief update have been proposed as two types of belief change serving differ ent purposes Belief revision is intended to capture changes of an agent's belief state reflecting new information about a static world Belief update is intended to capture changes of belief in response to a changing world. We argue that both belief revision and belief update are too restrictive, routine belief change involves elements of both. We present a model for generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform the agent about its prior beliefs. This model of update combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change. We show that, under certain assumptions, the original update postulates are satisfied. We also demonstrate that plain revision and plain update are special cases of our model, in a way that formally verifies the intuition that revision is suitable for "static" belief change.

    :abstractText: Coordination of agent activities is a key problem in multiagent systems. Set in a larger decision theoretic context, the existence of coordination problems leads to difficulty in evaluating the utility of a situation. This in turn makes defining optimal policies for sequential decision processes problematic. We propose a method for solving sequential multi-agent decision problems by allowing agents to reason explicitly about specific coordination mechanisms. We define an extension of value iteration in which the system's state space is augmented with the state of the coordination mechanism adopted, allowing agents to reason about the short and long term prospects for coordination, the long term consequences of (mis)coordination, and make decisions to engage or avoid coordination problems based on expected value. We also illustrate the benefits of mechanism generalization.

    :abstractText: We describe an approach to goal decomposition for a certain class of Markov decision processes (MDPs). An abstraction mechanism is used to generate abstract MDPs associated with different objectives, and several methods for merging the policies for these different objectives are considered. In one technique, causal (least-commitment) structures are generated for abstract policies and plan merging techniques, exploiting the relaxation of policy commitments reflected in this structure, are used to piece the results into a single policy. Abstract value functions provide guidance if plan repair is needed. This work makes some first steps toward the synthesis of classical and decision theoretic planning methods.

    :abstractText: Markov decision processes (MDPs) have recently been applied to the problem of modeling decision-theoretic planning. While traditional methods for solving MDPs are often practical for small states spaces, their effectiveness for large AI planning problems is questionable. We present an algorithm, called structured policy Iteration (SPI), that constructs optimal policies without explicit enumeration of the state space. The algorithm retains the fundamental computational steps of the commonly used modified policy iteration algorithm, but exploits the variable and prepositional independencies reflected in a temporal Bayesian network representation of MDPs. The principles behind SPI can be applied to any structured representation of stochastic actions, policies and value functions, and the algorithm itself can be used in conjunction with recent approximation methods.

    :abstractText: Market-based mechanisms such as auctions are being studied as an appropriate means for resource allocation in distributed and inultiagenl decision problems. When agents value resources in combination rather than in isolation, one generally relies on combinatorial auctions where agents bid tor resource bundles. or simultaneous auctions for all resources. We develop a different model, where agents bid for required reources sequentially. This model has the advantage that it can be applied in settings where combinatorial and simultaneous models are infeasible (e.g.. when resources are made available at different points in time by different parties), as well as certain benefits in settings where combinatorial models are applicable. We develop a dynamic programming model tor agents to compute bidding policies based on estimated distributions over prices. We also describe how these distributions are updated to provide a learning model for bidding behavior.

    :abstractText: Combinatorial auctions provide a valuable mechanism for the allocation of goods in settings where buyer valuations exhibit complex structure with respect to substitutability and complementarity. Most algorithms are designed to work with explicit bids for concrete bundles of goods. However, logical bidding languages allow the expression of complex utility functions in a natural and concise way. We introduce a new, generalized language where bids are given by propositional formulae whose subformulae can be annotated with prices. This language allows bidder utilities to be formulated more naturally and concisely than existing languages. Furthermore, we outline a general algorithmic technique for winner determination for auctions that use this bidding language.

    :abstractText: We argue that many AI planning problems should be viewed as process-oriented, where the aim is to produce a policy or behavior strategy with no termination condition in mind, as opposed to goal-onented. The full power of Markov decision models, adopted recently for AI planning, becomes apparent with process-oriented problems. The question of appropriate optimality criteria becomes more critical in this case, we argue that average reward optimal is most suitable While construction of averageoptimal policies involves a number of subtleties and computational difficulties, certain aspects of the problem can be solved using compact action representations such as Bayes nets. In particular, we provide an algorithm that identifies the structure of the Markov process underlying a planning problem - a crucial element of constructing average optimal policies - without explicit enumeration of the problem state space.

    :abstractText: We propose new methods of preference elicitation for constraint-based optimization problems based on the use of minimax regret. Specifically, we assume a constraintbased optimization problem (e.g., product configuration) in which the objective function (e.g., consumer preferences) are unknown or imprecisely specified. Assuming a graphical utility model, we describe several elicitation strategies that require the user to answer only binary (bound) queries on the utility model parameters. While a theoretically motivated algorithm can provably reduce regret quickly (in terms of number of queries), we demonstrate that, in practice, heuristic strategies perform much better, and are able to find optimal (or near-optimal) configurations with far fewer queries.

    :abstractText: We present a dynamic programming approach for the solution of first-order Markov decisions processes. This technique uses an MDP whose dynamics is represented in a variant of the situation calculus allowing for stochastic actions. It produces a logical description of the optimal value function and policy by constructing a set of first-order formulae that minimally partition state space according to distinctions made by the value function and policy. This is achieved through the use of an operation known as decision-theoretic regression. In effect, our algorithm performs value iteration without explicit enumeration of either the state or action spaces of the MDP. This allows problems involving relational fluents and quantification to be solved without requiring explicit state space enumeration or conversion to propositional form.

    :abstractText: In multiagent environments, forms of social learning such as teaching and imitation have been shown to aid the transfer of knowledge from experts to learners in reinforcement learning (RL). We recast the problem of imitation in a Bayesian framework. Our Bayesian imitation model allows a learner to smoothly pool prior knowledge, data obtained through interaction with the environment, and information inferred from observations of expert agent behaviors. Our model integrates well with recent Bayesian exploration techniques, and can be readily generalized to new settings.

    :abstractText: Classic direct mechanisms require full utility revelation from agents, which can be very difficult in practical multi-attribute settings. In this work, we study partial revelation within the framework of one-shot mechanisms. Each agent's type space is partitioned into a finite set of partial types and agents (should) report the partial type within which their full type lies. A classic result implies that implementation in dominant strategies is impossible in this model. We first show that a relaxation to Bayes-Nash implementation does not circumvent the problem. We then propose a class of partial revelation mechanisms that achieve approximate dominant strategy implementation, and describe a computationally tractable algorithm for myopically optimizing the partitioning of each agent's type space to reduce manipulability and social welfare loss. This allows for the automated design of one-shot partial revelation mechanisms with worst-case guarantees on both manipulability and efficiency.

    :abstractText: Coalition formation is a problem of great interest in AI, allowing groups of autonomous, individually rational agents to form stable teams. Automating the negotiations underlying coalition formation is, naturally, of special concern. However, research to date in both AI and economics has largely ignored the potential presence of uncertainty in coalitional bargaining. We present a model of discounted coalitional bargaining where agents are uncertain about the types (or capabilities) of potential partners, and hence the value of a coalition. We cast the problem as a Bayesian game in extensive form, and describe its Perfect Bayesian Equilibria as the solutions to a polynomial program. We then present a heuristic algorithm using iterative coalition formation to approximate the optimal solution, and evaluate its performance.

    :abstractText: "Mechanism design is the study of preference aggregation protocols that work well in the face of self-interested agents. We present the first general-purpose techniques for automatically designing multistage mechanisms. These can reduce elicitation burden by only querying agents for information that is relevant given their answers to previous queries. We first show how to turn a given (e.g., automatically designed using constrained optimization techniques) single-stage mechanism into the most efficient corresponding multistage mechanism given a specified elicitation tree. We then present greedy and dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that determine the elicitation tree (optimal in the DP case). Next, we show how the query savings inherent in the multistage model can be used to design the underlying single-stage mechanism to maximally take advantage of this approach. Finally, we present negative results on the design of multistage mechanisms that do not correspond to dominant-strategy single-stage mechanisms: an optimal multistage mechanism in general has to randomize over queries to hide information from the agents."

    :abstractText: Automated software customization is drawing increasing attention as a means to help users deal with the scope, complexity, potential intrusiveness, and ever-changing nature of modern software. The ability to automatically customize functionality, interfaces, and advice to specific users is made more difficult by the uncertainty about the needs of specific individuals and their preferences for interaction. Following recent probabilistic techniques in user modeling, we model our user with a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and propose to explicitly infer the "user's type" --- a composite of personality and affect variables --- in real time. We design the system to reason about the impact of its actions given the user's current attitudes. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, we describe a DBN model for a text-editing help task. We show, through simulations, that user types can be inferred quickly, and that a myopic policy offers considerable benefit by adapting to both different types and changing attitudes. We then develop a more realistic user model, using behavioural data from 45 users to learn model parameters and the topology of our proposed user types. With the new model, we conduct a usability experiment with 4 users and 4 different policies. These experiments, while preliminary, show encouraging results for our adaptive policy.

    :abstractText: Adaptive software systems are intended to modify their appearance, performance or functionality to the needs and preferences of different users. A key bottleneck in building effective adaptive systems is accounting for the cost of disruption to a user's mental model of the application caused by the system's adaptive behaviour. In this work, we propose a probabilistic approach to modeling the cost of disruption. This allows an adaptive system to tradeoff disruption cost with expected savings (or other benefits) induced by a potential adaptation in a principled, decision-theoretic fashion. We conducted two experiments with 48 participants to learn model parameters in an adaptive menu selection environment. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in simulation and usability studies. Usability results with 8 participants suggest that our approach is competitive with other adaptive menus w.r.t. task performance, while providing the ability to reduce disruption and adapt to user preferences.

    :abstractText: There has been a growing interest in AI in the design of multiagent systems, especially in multiagent cooperative planning. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which methods from single-agent planning and learning can be applied in multiagent settings. We survey a number of different techniques from decision-theoretic planning and reinforcement learning and describe a number of interesting issues that arise with regard to coordinating the policies of individual agents. To this end, we describe <i>multiagent Markov decision processes</i> as a general model in which to frame this discussion. These are special <i>n-</i>person cooperative games in which agents share the same utility function. We discuss coordination mechanisms based on imposed conventions (or social laws) as well as learning methods for coordination. Our focus is on the decomposition of sequential decision processes so that coordination can be learned (or imposed) locally, at the level of individual states. We also discuss the use of structured problem representations and their role in the generalization of learned conventions and in approximation.

    :abstractText: Mechanism design has found considerable application to the construction of agent-interaction protocols. In the standard setting, the type (e.g., utility function) of an agent is not known by other agents, nor is it known by the mechanism designer. When this uncertainty is quantified probabilistically, a mechanism induces a game of incomplete information among the agents. However, in many settings, uncertainty over utility functions cannot easily be quantified. We consider the problem of incomplete information games in which type uncertainty is <i>strict</i> or unquantified. We propose the use of <i>minimax regret</i> as a decision criterion in such games, a robust approach for dealing with type uncertainty. We define <i>minimax-regret equilibria</i> and prove that these exist in mixed strategies for finite games. We also consider the problem of mechanism design in this framework by adopting minimax regret as an optimization criterion for the designer itself, and study automated optimization of such mechanisms.

    :abstractText: "The Katsuno and Mendelzon theory of belief update has been proposed as a reasonable model for revising beliefs about a changing world. However, the semantics of update relies on information which is not readily available. We describe an alternative semantical view of update in which observations are incorporated into a belief set by: a) explaining the observation in terms of a set of plausible events that might have caused that observation; and b) predicting further consequences of those explanations. We also allow the possibility of conditional explanations. We show that this picture naturally induces an update operator under certain assumptions. However, we argue that these assumptions are not always reasonable, and they restrict our ability to integrate update with other forms of revision when reasoning about action."

    :abstractText: "In many situations, a set of hard constraints encodes the feasible configurations of some system or product over which multiple users have distinct preferences. However, making suitable decisions requires that the preferences of a specific user for different configurations be articulated or elicited, something generally acknowledged to be onerous. We address two problems associated with preference elicitation: computing a best feasible solution when the user's utilities are imprecisely specified; and developing useful elicitation procedures that reduce utility uncertainty, with minimal user interaction, to a point where (approximately) optimal decisions can be made. Our main contributions are threefold. First, we propose the use of minimax regret as a suitable decision criterion for decision making in the presence of such utility function uncertainty. Second, we devise several different procedures, all relying on mixed integer linear programs, that can be used to compute minimax regret and regret-optimizing solutions effectively. In particular, our methods exploit generalized additive structure in a user's utility function to ensure tractable computation. Third, we propose various elicitation methods that can be used to refine utility uncertainty in such a way as to quickly (i.e., with as few questions as possible) reduce minimax regret. Empirical study suggests that several of these methods are quite successful in minimizing the number of user queries, while remaining computationally practical so as to admit real-time user interaction."

    :abstractText: Many traditional solution approaches to relationally specified decision-theoretic planning problems (e.g., those stated in the probabilistic planning domain description language, or PPDDL) ground the specification with respect to a specific instantiation of domain objects and apply a solution approach directly to the resulting ground Markov decision process (MDP). Unfortunately, the space and time complexity of these grounded solution approaches are polynomial in the number of domain objects and exponential in the predicate arity and the number of nested quantifiers in the relational problem specification. An alternative to grounding a relational planning problem is to tackle the problem directly at the relational level. In this article, we propose one such approach that translates an expressive subset of the PPDDL representation to a first-order MDP (FOMDP) specification and then derives a domain-independent policy without grounding at any intermediate step. However, such generality does not come without its own set of challenges-the purpose of this article is to explore practical solution techniques for solving FOMDPs. To demonstrate the applicability of our techniques, we present proof-of-concept results of our first-order approximate linear programming (FOALP) planner on problems from the probabilistic track of the ICAPS 2004 and 2006 International Planning Competitions.

    :abstractText: In order to generate plans for agents with multiple actuators, agent teams, or distributed controllers, we must be able to represent and plan using concurrent actions with interacting effects. This has historically been considered a challenging task requiring a temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly about time. We show that with simple modifications, the STRIPS action representation language can be used to represent interacting actions. Moreover, algorithms for partial-order planning require only small modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains. We demonstrate this fact by developing a sound and complete partial-order planner for planning with concurrent interacting actions, POMP, that extends existing partial-order planners in a straightforward way. These results open the way to the use of partial-order planners for the centralized control of cooperative multiagent systems.

    :abstractText: Information about user preferences plays a key role in automated decision making. In many domains it is desirable to assess such preferences in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. In this paper, we propose a qualitative graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is often compact and arguably quite natural in many circumstances. We provide a formal semantics for this model, and describe how the structure of the network can be exploited in several inference tasks, such as determining whether one outcome dominates (is preferred to) another, ordering a set outcomes according to the preference relation, and constructing the best outcome subject to available evidence.

    :abstractText: Imitation can be viewed as a means of enhancing learning in multiagent environments. It augments an agent's ability to learn useful behaviors by making intelligent use of the knowledge implicit in behaviors demonstrated by cooperative teachers or other more experienced agents. We propose and study a formal model of implicit imitation that can accelerate reinforcement learning dramatically in certain cases. Roughly, by observing a mentor, a reinforcement-learning agent can extract information about its own capabilities in, and the relative value of, unvisited parts of the state space. We study two specific instantiations of this model, one in which the learning agent and the mentor have identical abilities, and one designed to deal with agents and mentors with difierent action sets. We illustrate the benefits of implicit imitation by integrating it with prioritized sweeping, and demonstrating improved performance and convergence through observation of single and multiple mentors. Though we make some stringent assumptions regarding observability and possible interactions, we briefly comment on extensions of the model that relax these restricitions.

    :abstractText: "Current conversational recommender systems are unable to offer guarantees on the quality of their recommendations due to a lack of principled user utility models. We develop an approach to recommender systems that incorporates an explicit utility model into the recommendation process in a decision-theoretically sound fashion. The system maintains explicit constraints on user utility based on preferences revealed by the user's actions. We investigate a new decision criterion, setwise minimax regret (SMR), for constructing optimal recommendation sets: we develop algorithms for computing SMR, and prove that SMR determines choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal. This provides a natural basis for generating compound critiques in conversational recommender systems. Our simulation results suggest that this utility-theoretically sound approach to user modeling allows much more effective navigation of a product space than traditional approaches based on, for example, heuristic utility models and product similarity measures."

    :abstractText: Utility or preference elicitation is a critical component in many recommender and decision support systems. However, most frameworks for elicitation assume a predefined set of features (e.g., as derived from catalog descriptions) over which user preferences are expressed. Just as user preferences vary considerably, so too can the features over which they are most comfortable expressing these preferences. In this work, we consider preference elicitation in the presence of subjective or user-defined features. We treat the problem of learning a user's feature definition as one of concept learning, but whose goal is to learn only enough about the concept definition to enable a good decision to be made. This is complicated by the fact that user preferences are unknown. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t minimax regret in the presence of both utility and concept uncertainty; and develop several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of relevant concept and utility uncertainty. Computational experiments verify the efficacy of these strategies.

    :abstractText: Optical microscopes remain keen instruments for scientific research nowadays. Widely used in hospitals and laboratories, such equipment helps people deal with various kinds of tasks, most of which, however, are both onerous and tedious; therefore, operations on these manually executed instruments are lengthily and subject to human errors. To alleviate this problem, we equip an optical microscope with two stepper motors and implement the automatic control of the microscope stage. This paper introduces the control system architecture and discusses in detail the development of the communication subsystem and the stepper motor controllers. Test results with a practical application are also provided to illustrate the performance of this system.

    :abstractText: Discovering non-trivial matching subsequences from two time series is very useful in synthesizing novel time series. This can be applied to applications such as motion synthesis where smooth and natural motion sequences are often required to be generated from existing motion sequences. We first address this problem by defining it as a problem of l-epsiv-join over two time series. Given two time series, the goal of l-epsiv-join is to find those non-trivial matching subsequences by detecting maximal l-connections from the epsiv-matching matrix of the two time series. Given a querying motion sequence, the l-epsiv-join can be applied to retrieve all connectable motion sequences from a database of motion sequences. To support efficient l-epsiv-join of time series, we propose a two-step filter-and-refine algorithm, called warping time series join (WTSJ) algorithm. The filtering step serves to prune those sparse regions of the epsiv-matching matrix where there are no maximal l-connections without incurring costly computation. The refinement step serves to detect closed l-connections within regions that cannot be pruned by the filtering step. To speed up the computation of epsiv-matching matrix, we propose a block-based time series summarization method, based on which the block-wise epsiv-matching matrix is first computed. Lots of pairwise distance computation of elements can then be avoided by applying the filtering algorithm on the block-wise epsiv-matching matrix. Extensive experiments on l-epsiv-join of motion capture sequences are conducted. The results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in processing l-epsiv-join of motion capture time series.

We present a methodology and a tool that allow the high-level synthesis of a DSP algorithm, under both I/O timing and memory constraints. Based on formal models and a generic architecture, this tool helps the designer to find a reasonable trade-off between the required I/O timing behavior and the internal memory access parallelism of the circuit. The interest of our approach is demonstrated by the case study of an FFT algorithm.

    :abstractText: One of the fundamental problems in the theory of social choice is aggregating the rankings of a set of agents (or voters) into a consensus ranking. Rank aggregation has found application in a variety of computational contexts. However, the goal of constructing a consensus ranking rather than, say, a single outcome (or winner) is often left unjustified, calling into question the suitability of classical rank aggregation methods. We introduce a novel model which offers a decision-theoretic motivation for constructing a consensus ranking. Our unavailable candidate model assumes that a consensus choice must be made, but that candidates may become unavailable after voters express their preferences. Roughly speaking, a consensus ranking serves as a compact, easily communicable representation of a decision policy that can be used to make choices in the face of uncertain candidate availability. We use this model to define a principled aggregation method that minimizes expected voter dissatisfaction with the chosen candidate. We give exact and approximation algorithms for computing optimal rankings and provide computational evidence for the effectiveness of a simple greedy scheme. We also describe strong connections to popular voting protocols such as the plurality rule and the Kemeny consensus, showing specifically that Kemeny produces optimal rankings in the unavailable candidate model under certain conditions.

    :abstractText: "Product recommendation and decision support systems must generally develop a model of user preferences by querying or otherwise interacting with a user. Recent approaches to elicitation using minimax regret have proven to be very powerful in simulation. In this work, we test both the effectiveness of regret-based elicitation, and user comprehension and acceptance of minimax regret in user studies. We report on a study involving 40 users interacting with the UTPref Recommendation System, which helps students navigate and find rental accommodation. UTPref maintains an explicit (but incomplete) generalized additive utility (GAI) model of user preferences, and uses minimax regret for recommendation. We assess the following general questions: How effective is regret-based elicitation in finding optimal or near-optimal products? Do users understand and accept the minimax regret criterion in practice? Do decision-theoretically valid queries for GAI models result in more accurate assessment than simpler, ad hoc queries? On the first two issues, we find that the minimax regret decision criterion is effective, understandable, and intuitively appealing. On the third issue, we find that simple, semantically ambiguous query types perform as well as more demanding, semantically valid queries for GAI models. We also assess the relative difficulty of specific query types."

    :abstractText: In this paper we develop a computer vision-based system to transfer human motion from one subject to another. Our system uses a network of eight calibrated and synchronized cameras. We first build detailed kinematic models of the subjects based on our algorithms for extracting shape from silhouette across time [A 3D reconstruction algorithm combining shape-frame-shilhouette]. These models are then used to capture the motion (joint angles) of the subjects in new video sequences. Finally we describe an image-based rendering algorithm to render the captured motion applied to the articulated model of another person. Our rendering algorithm uses an ensemble of spatially and temporally distributed images to generate photo-realistic video of the transferred motion. We demonstrate the performance of the system by rendering throwing and kungfu motions on subjects who did not perform them.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we explore how dynamic visual cues can be used to create accessible and meaningful social interfaces without raising expectations beyond what is achievable with current technology. Our approach is inspired by research in perceptual causality, which suggests that simple displays in motion can evoke high-level social and emotional content. For our exploration, we iteratively designed and implemented a public social interface using abstraction and motion as design elements. Our interface communicated simple social and emotional content such as displaying happiness when there is high social interaction in the environment. Our qualitative evaluations showed that people frequently and repeatedly interacted with the interface while they tried to make sense of the underlying social content. They also shared their models with others, which led to more social interaction in the environment.

    :abstractText: Many classes of applications require multiagent navigation control algorithms to specify the movements and actions of heterogeneous groups containing thousands of characters. The scale and complexity of these interacting character groups require navigation control algorithms that are both generalizable and specifically tuned to particular character platforms. We propose a technique called simulation level of detail (LOD) that provides a simulation-based interface between navigation control algorithms and the specific mobile characters on which they operate. A simulation LOD efficiently models a character's ability to move given its dynamic state and provides this simplified version of the character to navigation controllers for use in run-time search algorithms that compute locomotion actions. We develop our simulation LOD algorithms on groups of physically simulated human and alien bicyclists and demonstrate reusable controllers that provide improvements in path following and herding tasks.

    :abstractText: "In this paper we demonstrate a method for fine-grained modeling of a synthetic agent\xC3\xBDs physical capabilities \xC2\xBF running, jumping, sneaking, and other modes of movement. Using motion capture data acquired from human subjects, we extract a motion graph and construct a cost map for the space of agent actions. We show how a planner can incorporate this cost model into the planning process to select between equivalent goal-achieving plans. We explore the utility of our model in three different capacities: 1) modeling other agents in the environment; 2) representing heterogeneous agents with different physical capabilities; 3) modeling agent physical states (e.g., wounded or tired agents). This technique can be incorporated into applications where human-like, high-fidelity physical models are important to the agents\xC3\xBD reasoning process, such as virtual training environments."

    :abstractText: To present an accurate and compelling view of a new environment,architectural and urban planning applicationsboth require animations of people. Ideally, these animationswould be easy for a non-programmer to construct, justas buildings and streets can be modeled by an architect orartist using commercial modeling software. In this paper,we explore an approach for generating reactive path followingbased on the user's examples of the desired behavior.The examples are used to build a model of the desired reactivebehavior. The model is combined with reactive controlmethods to produce natural 2D pedestrian trajectories. Thesystem then automatically generates 3D pedestrian locomotionusing motion capture resequencing algorithms. We discussthe accuracy of the model of pedestrian motion andshow that simple direction primitives can be recorded andused to build natural, reactive, path-following behaviors.

The forces generated by the objects create waves and splashes on the surface of the fluid. To demonstrate the realism and limitations of the model, images from a computer-generated animation are presented and compared with video frames of actual splashes occurring under similar initial conditions.

We argue that such toys, suitably instrumented or sensed, could be the inspiration for a new generation of easy-to-use, tangible modeling systems&mdash;especially if the tangible modeling is combined with graphical-interpretation techniques for enhancing nascent models automatically. The three key technologies needed to realize this idea are embedded computation, vision-based acquisition, and graphical interpretation. We sample these technologies in the context of two novel modeling systems: physical building blocks that self-describe, interpret, and decorate the structures into which they are assembled; and a system for scanning, interpreting, and animating clay figures."

    :abstractText: "Real-time control of three-dimensional avatars is an important problem in the context of computer games and virtual environments. Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for flexibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we describe a method for realistically animating ductile fracture in common solid materials such as plastics and metals. The effects that characterize ductile fracture occur due to interaction between plastic yielding and the fracture process. By modeling this interaction, our ductile fracture method can generate realistic motion for a much wider range of materials than could be realized with a purely brittle model. This method directly extends our prior work on brittle fracture [O'Brien and Hodgins, SIGGRAPH 99]. We show that adapting that method to ductile as well as brittle materials requires only a simple to implement modification that is computationally inexpensive. This paper describes this modification and presents results demonstrating some of the effects that may be realized with it.

    :abstractText: "This paper is about the use of control algorithms to animate dynamic legged locomotion. Control could free the animator from specifying the details of joint and limb motion while producing both physically realistic and natural looking results. We implemented computer animations of a biped robot, a quadruped robot, and a kangaroo. Each creature was modeled as a linked set of rigid bodies with compliant actuators at its joints. Control algorithms regulated the running speed, organized use of the legs, and maintained balance. All motions were generated by numerically integrating equations of motion derived from the physical models. The resulting behavior included running at various speeds, traveling with several gaits (run, trot, bound, gallop, and hop), jumping, and traversing simple paths. Whereas the use of control permitted a variety of physically realistic animated behavior to be generated with limited human intervention, the process of designing the control algorithms was not automated: the algorithms were \"tweaked\" and adjusted for each new creature."

    :abstractText: We present a method for designing truss structures, a common and complex category of buildings, using non-linear optimization. Truss structures are ubiquitous in the industrialized world, appearing as bridges, towers, roof supports and building exoskeletons, yet are complex enough that modeling them by hand is time consuming and tedious. We represent trusses as a set of rigid bars connected by pin joints, which may change location during optimization. By including the location of the joints as well as the strength of individual beams in our design variables, we can simultaneously optimize the geometry and the mass of structures. We present the details of our technique together with examples illustrating its use, including comparisons with real structures.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we introduce techniques for animating explosions and their effects. The primary effect of an explosion is a disturbance that causes a shock wave to propagate through the surrounding medium. The disturbance determines the behavior of nearly all other secondary effects seen in explosion. We simulate the propagation of an explosion through the surrounding air using a computational fluid dynamics model based on the equations for compressible, viscous flow. To model the numerically stable formation of shocks along blast wave fronts, we employ an integration method that can handle steep pressure gradients without introducing inappropriate damping. The system includes two-way coupling between solid objects and surrounding fluid. Using this technique, we can generate a variety of effects including shaped explosive charges, a projectile propelled from a chamber by an explosion, and objects damaged by a blast. With appropriate rendering techniques, our explosion model can be used to create such visual effects as fireballs, dust clouds, and the refraction of light caused by a blast wave.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present a methodology for recognizing seated postures using data from pressure sensors installed on a chair. Information about seated postures could be used to help avoid adverse effects of sitting for long periods of time or to predict seated activities for a human-computer interface. Our system design displays accurate near-real-time classification performance on data from subjects on which the posture recognition system was not trained by using a set of carefully designed, subject-invariant signal features. By using a near-optimal sensor placement strategy, we keep the number of required sensors low thereby reducing cost and computational complexity. We evaluated the performance of our technology using a series of empirical methods including (1) cross-validation (classification accuracy of 87% for ten postures using data from 31 sensors), and (2) a physical deployment of our system (78% classification accuracy using data from 19 sensors).

    :abstractText: Recent developments in humanoid robotics have made possible a vision of robots in everyday use in the home and workplace. However, little is known about how we should design social interactions with humanoid robots. We explored how co-operation versus competition in a game shaped people's perceptions of ASIMO. We found that in the co-operative interaction, people found the robot more sociable and more intellectual than in the competitive interaction while people felt more positive and were more involved in the task in the competitive condition than in the co-operative condition. Our poster presents these findings with the supporting theoretical background.

    :abstractText: "An experiment to determine factors that influence the perceived sex of virtual characters was conducted. Four different model types were used: highly realistic male and female models, an androgynous character, and a point light walker. Three different types of motion were applied to all models: motion captured male and female walks, and neutral synthetic walks. We found that both form and motion influence sex perception for these characters: for neutral synthetic motions, form determines perceived sex, whereas natural motion affects the perceived sex of both androgynous and realistic forms. These results have implications on variety and realism when simulating large crowds of virtual characters."

This paper explores strategies that would enable legged robots to respond to two common types of surface contact error: slipping and tripping. Because of the rapid response required and the difficulty of sensing uneven terrain, we propose a set of reflexes that would permit the robot to react without modeling or analyzing the error condition in detail. These reflexive responses allow robust recovery from a variety of contact errors. We present simulation trials for single-slip tasks with varying coefficients of friction and single-trip tasks with varying obstacle heights."

Animals in these groups must remain in close proximity while avoiding collisions with neighbors and with obstacles. We would like to reproduce this behavior for groups of simulated creatures traveling fast enough that dynamics plays a significant role in determining their movement. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for controlling the movements of creatures that travel as a group and evaluate the performance of the algorithm with three simulated systems: legged robots, humanlike bicycle riders, and point-mass systems. Both the legged robots and the bicyclists are dynamic simulations that must control balance, facing direction, and forward speed as well as position within the group. The simpler point-mass systems are included because they help us to understand the effects of the dynamics on the performance of the algorithm."

    :abstractText: Objects that move in response to the actions of a main character often make an important contribution to the visual richness of an animated scene. We use the term "secondary motion" to refer to passive motions generated in response to the movements of characters and other objects or environmental forces. Secondary motions aren't normally the mail focus of an animated scene, yet their absence can distract or disturb the viewer, destroying the illusion of reality created by the scene. We describe how to generate secondary motion by coupling physically based simulations of passive objects to actively controlled characters.

Also, that exaggerated female body shapes influences sex judgements more than exaggerated male shapes. These results have implications for variety and realism when simulating large crowds of virtual characters."

    :abstractText: This paper introduces an approach to performance animation that employs video cameras and a small set of retro-reflective markers to create a low-cost, easy-to-use system that might someday be practical for home use. The low-dimensional control signals from the user's performance are supplemented by a database of pre-recorded human motion. At run time, the system automatically learns a series of local models from a set of motion capture examples that are a close match to the marker locations captured by the cameras. These local models are then used to reconstruct the motion of the user as a full-body animation. We demonstrate the power of this approach with real-time control of six different behaviors using two video cameras and a small set of retro-reflective markers. We compare the resulting animation to animation from commercial motion capture equipment with a full set of markers.

The algorithm analyzes the motion of textured particles in the input video along user-specified flow lines, and synthesizes seamless video of arbitrary length by enforcing temporal continuity along a second set of user-specified flow lines. The algorithm is simple to implement and use. We used this technique to edit video of water-falls, rivers, flames, and smoke.

    :abstractText: "I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to take over as editor-in-chief after Holly Rushmeier's strong leadership of the past three years. ACM has made a big effort to get TOG back on schedule after the delays caused by changing to a new publication system. With this issue, we are almost on schedule again and the backlog of accepted papers is significantly reduced. I hope to further shorten the time the return reviews to authors and to get accepted paper to readers. As part of that effort, I have asked Steve Fortune for Bell Labs, John Hart from Washington State, Joe Marks from MERL, and Jorg Peters from the University of Florida to be new members of the editorial board to replace those who retired with the end of Holly's term.I expect that we'll see significant changes in the role of journals during my three-year term. Right now, journals utilize peer reviews and a revision cycle to provide accreditation to research, but this process is tied to a particular distribution medium and requires financial support in the form of subscription fees. With the increasing use of web-baed publishing, I expect that the accreditation and distribution functions will begin to separate. Accreditation will continue to play an important role in scientific reputations and academic careers, while the publication media will become far more diverse. This diversification is particularly important for graphics because many of its important results are not represented well on paper. TOG has moved in this direction with a web page that is expertly maintained by Eric Haines and contains occasional supplemental material (http://www.acm.org./tog/). If TOG is to represent the true breadth of graphics, however, we will have to make much more of an effort in this direction.During the next three years, we will almost certainly see significant changes in graphics as well. Clearly, the field is expanding beyond the creation of beautiful and useful images and image sequences. New emphases include increasingly realistic physical modeling, interactive worlds, and nonvisual modalities. Graphics is a fascinating field, in part because researchers are able to adopt and adapt new ideas from so many other fields: art, vision, physics, materials science, control, optimization and biomechanics. I look forward to the innovative and creative work that the community will submit to TOG during the next three years."

    :abstractText: I've now been Editor-in-Chief of ACM TOG for two full years. We've made a number of changes in TOG recently. Perhaps the most visible change is the new format which began with January 2002. The format change is to more closely approximate that of ACM SIGGRAPH.The July 2002 issue of TOG will be the Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH. These papers will be conditionally accepted at the SIGGRAPH Program Committee meeting in March 2002 and then will undergo a second reviewing phase in which a referee will ensure that the authors have altered the paper to address the concerns of the original reviewers. This referee's job will be much like that of the associate editor in the normal TOG review process.As you have no doubt noticed, publication of TOG has not kept pace with the calendar. However, the number of submissions has increased substantially (57 in 2001 versus 34 in 2000) and the time until the authors receive the first decision on their paper has been reduced to less than four months for almost every paper. We should be publishing on time by the next regular issue, October 2002, and will then be able to start building a backlog of accepted papers at ACM to keep the issues on schedule.This improvement has been made possible by the hard work of the Associate Editors listed in the front cover of the journal and by the reviewers who are listed at the end of this issue. I'm very grateful to both groups for their significant help throughout the year.I hope that the next year sees another 50&percnt; or larger increase in the number of submissions. I would be happy to have twice as much work to do so please keep sending those strong submissions our way.

Avatar animation and control is difficult, however, because a large repertoire of avatar behaviors must be made available, and the user must be able to select from this set of behaviors, possibly with a low-dimensional input device. One appealing approach to obtaining a rich set of avatar behaviors is to collect an extended, unlabeled sequence of motion data appropriate to the application. In this paper, we show that such a motion database can be preprocessed for flexibility in behavior and efficient search and exploited for real-time avatar control. Flexibility is created by identifying plausible transitions between motion segments, and efficient search through the resulting graph structure is obtained through clustering. Three interface techniques are demonstrated for controlling avatar motion using this data structure: the user selects from a set of available choices, sketches a path through an environment, or acts out a desired motion in front of a video camera. We demonstrate the flexibility of the approach through four different applications and compare the avatar motion to directly recorded human motion."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we describe a method for realistically animating ductile fracture in common solid materials such as plastics and metals. The effects that characterize ductile fracture occur due to interaction between plastic yielding and the fracture process. By modeling this interaction, our ductile fracture method can generate realistic motion for a much wider range of materials than could be realized with a purely brittle model. This method directly extends our prior work on brittle fracture [O'Brien and Hodgins, SIGGRAPH 99]. We show that adapting that method to ductile as well as brittle materials requires only a simple to implement modification that is computationally inexpensive. This paper describes this modification and presents results demonstrating some of the effects that may be realized with it.

    :abstractText: "During dynamic activities, the surface of the human body moves in many subtle but visually significant ways: bending, bulging, jiggling, and stretching. We present a technique for capturing and animating those motions using a commercial motion capture system and approximately 350 markers. Although the number of markers is significantly larger than that used in conventional motion capture, it is only a sparse representation of the true shape of the body. We supplement this sparse sample with a detailed, actor-specific surface model. The motion of the skin can then be computed by segmenting the markers into the motion of a set of rigid parts and a residual deformation (approximated first as a quadratic transformation and then with radial basis functions). We demonstrate the power of this approach by capturing flexing muscles, high frequency motions, and abrupt decelerations on several actors. We compare these results both to conventional motion capture and skinning and to synchronized video of the actors."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to develop a measure that quantifies the naturalness of human motion (as defined by a large database). Such a measure might prove useful in verifying that a motion editing operation had not destroyed the naturalness of a motion capture clip or that a synthetic motion transition was within the space of those seen in natural human motion. We explore the performance of mixture of Gaussians (MoG), hidden Markov models (HMM), and switching linear dynamic systems (SLDS) on this problem. We use each of these statistical models alone and as part of an ensemble of smaller statistical models. We also implement a Naive Bayes (NB) model for a baseline comparison. We test these techniques on motion capture data held out from a database, keyframed motions, edited motions, motions with noise added, and synthetic motion transitions. We present the results as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compare the results to the judgments made by subjects in a user study.

    :abstractText: We present a vision-based performance interface for controlling animated human characters. The system interactively combines information about the user's motion contained in silhouettes from three viewpoints with domain knowledge contained in a motion capture database to produce an animation of high quality. Such an interactive system might be useful for authoring, for teleconferencing, or as a control interface for a character in a game. In our implementation, the user performs in front of three video cameras; the resulting silhouettes are used to estimate his orientation and body configuration based on a set of discriminative local features. Those features are selected by a machine-learning algorithm during a preprocessing step. Sequences of motions that approximate the user's actions are extracted from the motion database and scaled in time to match the speed of the user's motion. We use swing dancing, a complex human motion, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We compare our results to those obtained with a set of global features, Hu moments, and ground truth measurements from a motion capture system.

    :abstractText: Optimization is an appealing way to compute the motion of an animated character because it allows the user to specify the desired motion in a sparse, intuitive way. The difficulty of solving this problem for complex characters such as humans is due in part to the high dimensionality of the search space. The dimensionality is an artifact of the problem representation because most dynamic human behaviors are intrinsically low dimensional with, for example, legs and arms operating in a coordinated way. We describe a method that exploits this observation to create an optimization problem that is easier to solve. Our method utilizes an existing motion capture database to find a low-dimensional space that captures the properties of the desired behavior. We show that when the optimization problem is solved within this low-dimensional subspace, a sparse sketch can be used as an initial guess and full physics constraints can be enabled. We demonstrate the power of our approach with examples of forward, vertical, and turning jumps; with running and walking; and with several acrobatic flips.

    :abstractText: We present a method for designing truss structures, a common and complex category of buildings, using non-linear optimization. Truss structures are ubiquitous in the industrialized world, appearing as bridges, towers, roof supports and building exoskeletons, yet are complex enough that modeling them by hand is time consuming and tedious. We represent trusses as a set of rigid bars connected by pin joints, which may change location during optimization. By including the location of the joints as well as the strength of individual beams in our design variables, we can simultaneously optimize the geometry and the mass of structures. We present the details of our technique together with examples illustrating its use, including comparisons with real structures.

    :abstractText: High contrast images are common in night scenes and other scenes that include dark shadows and bright light sources. These scenes are difficult to display because their contrasts greatly exceed the range of most display devices for images. As a result, the image constrasts are compressed or truncated, obscuring subtle textures and details. Humans view and understand high contrast scenes easily, &ldquo;adapting&rdquo; their visual response to avoid compression or truncation with no apparent loss of detail. By imitating some of these visual adaptation processes, we developed methods for the improved display of high-contrast images. The first builds a display image from several layers of lighting and surface properties. Only the lighting layers are compressed, drastically reducing contrast while preserving much of the image detail. This method is practical only for synthetic images where the layers can be retained from the rendering process. The second method interactively adjusts the displayed image to preserve local contrasts in a small &ldquo;foveal&rdquo; neighborhood. Unlike the first method, this technique is usable on any image and includes a new tone reproduction operator. Both methods use a sigmoid function for contrast compression. This function has no effect when applied to small signals but compresses large signals to fit within an asymptotic limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by comparing processed and unprocessed images.

    :abstractText: Even such simple tasks as placing a box on a shelf are difficult to animate, because the animator must carefully position the character to satisfy geometric and balance constraints while creating motion to perform the task with a natural-looking style. In this paper, we explore an approach for animating characters manipulating objects that combines the power of path planning with the domain knowledge inherent in data-driven, constraint-based inverse kinematics. A path planner is used to find a motion for the object such that the corresponding poses of the character satisfy geometric, kinematic, and posture constraints. The inverse kinematics computation of the character's pose resolves redundancy by biasing the solution toward natural-looking poses extracted from a database of captured motions. Having this database greatly helps to increase the quality of the output motion. The computed path is converted to a motion trajectory using a model of the velocity profile. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by generating animations across a wide range of scenarios that cover variations in the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic models of the character, the manipulated object, and obstacles in the scene.

    :abstractText: We present an extension to Lagrangian finite element methods to allow for large plastic deformations of solid materials. These behaviors are seen in such everyday materials as shampoo, dough, and clay as well as in fantastic gooey and blobby creatures in special effects scenes. To account for plastic deformation, we explicitly update the linear basis functions defined over the finite elements during each simulation step. When these updates cause the basis functions to become ill-conditioned, we remesh the simulation domain to produce a new high-quality finite-element mesh, taking care to preserve the original boundary. We also introduce an enhanced plasticity model that preserves volume and includes creep and work hardening/softening. We demonstrate our approach with simulations of synthetic objects that squish, dent, and flow. To validate our methods, we compare simulation results to videos of real materials.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present a technique for generating animation from a variety of user-defined constraints. We pose constraint-based motion synthesis as a maximum a posterior (MAP) problem and develop an optimization framework that generates natural motion satisfying user constraints. The system automatically learns a statistical dynamic model from motion capture data and then enforces it as a motion prior. This motion prior, together with user-defined constraints, comprises a trajectory optimization problem. Solving this problem in the low-dimensional space yields optimal natural motion that achieves the goals specified by the user. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by generating whole-body and facial motion from a variety of spatial-temporal constraints.

    :abstractText: Many compelling applications would become feasible if novice users had the ability to synthesize high quality human motion based only on a simple sketch and a few easily specified constraints. We approach this problem by representing the desired motion as an interpolation of two time-scaled paths through a motion graph. The graph is constructed to support interpolation and pruned for efficient search. We use an anytime version of A* search to find a globally optimal solution in this graph that satisfies the user's specification. Our approach retains the natural transitions of motion graphs and the ability to synthesize physically realistic variations provided by interpolation. We demonstrate the power of this approach by synthesizing optimal or near optimal motions that include a variety of behaviors in a single motion.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we present a data-driven technique for synthesizing skin deformation from skeletal motion. We first create a database of dynamic skin deformations by recording the motion of the surface of the skin with a very large set of motion capture markers. We then build a statistical model of the deformations by dividing them into two parts: static and dynamic. Static deformations are modeled as a function of pose. Dynamic deformations are caused by the actions of the muscles as they move the joints and the inertia of muscles and fat. We approximate these effects by fitting a set of dynamic equations to the pre-recorded data. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by generating skin deformations from the skeletal motion of an actor. We compare the generated animation both to synchronized video of the actor and to ground truth animation created directly from the large marker set."

    :abstractText: In late 2006, Nintendo released a new game controller, the Wiimote, which included a three-axis accelerometer. Since then, a large variety of novel applications for these controllers have been developed by both independent and commercial developers. We add to this growing library with three performance interfaces that allow the user to control the motion of a dynamically simulated, animated character through the motion of his or her arms, wrists, or legs. For comparison, we also implement a traditional joystick/button interface. We assess these interfaces by having users test them on a set of tracks containing turns and pits. Two of the interfaces (legs and wrists) were judged to be more immersive and were better liked than the joystick/button interface by our subjects. All three of the Wiimote interfaces provided better control than the joystick interface based on an analysis of the failures seen during the user study.

Subjects were shown a series of paired motion sequences and asked if the two motions in each pair were the same or different The motion sequences in each pair were rendered using the same geometric model. For the three types of motion variation tested, sensitivity scores indicate that subjects were better able to observe changes with the polygonal model than they were with the stick figure model.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents a control framework for humanoid robots that uses all joints simultaneously to track motion capture data and maintain balance. The controller comprises two main components: a balance controller and a tracking controller. The balance controller uses a regulator designed for a simplified humanoid model to obtain the desired input to keep balance based on the current state of the robot. The simplified model is chosen so that a regulator can be designed systematically using, for example, optimal control. An example of such controller is a linear quadratic regulator designed for an inverted pendulum model. The desired inputs are typically the center of pressure and/or torques of some representative joints. The tracking controller then computes the joint torques that minimize the difference from desired inputs as well as the error from desired joint accelerations to track the motion capture data, considering exact full-body dynamics. We demonstrate that the proposed controller effectively reproduces different styles of storytelling motion using dynamics simulation considering limitations in hardware."

    :abstractText: "Animated characters can play the role of teachers or guides, teammates or competitors, or just provide a source of interesting motion in virtual environments. The characters in a compelling virtual environment must have a wide variety of complex and interesting behaviors and must be responsive to the user's actions. The difficulty of constructing such synthetic characters currently hinders the development of these environments, particularly when realism is required. We present one approach to populating virtual environments, using dynamic simulation to generate characters' motion. We explore the effectiveness of this approach with two virtual environments: the Border Collie Environment, in which the user acts as a border collie to herd robots into a corral, and the Olympic Bicycle Race Environment, in which the user participates in a bicycle race with synthetic competitors."

    :abstractText: "To realize the full potential of human simulations in interactive environments, we need controllers that have the ability to respond appropriately to unexpected events. In this paper, we create controllers for the trip recovery responses that occur during walking. Two strategies have been identified in human responses to tripping: impact from an obstacle during early swing leads to an elevating strategy, in which the swing leg is lifted over the obstacle and impact during late swing leads to a lowering strategy, in which a swing leg is positioned immediately in front of the obstacle and then the other leg is swung forward and positioned in front of the body to allow recovery from the fall. We design controllers for both strategies based on the available biomechanical literature and data captured from human subjects in the laboratory. We evaluate our controllers by comparing simulated results and actual responses obtained from a motion capture system."

    :abstractText: The skills required to create compelling three-dimensional animation using computer software are quite different from those required to create compelling hand animation with pencil and paper. The three-dimensional medium has several advantages over the traditional medium---it is easy to relight the scene, render it from different view-points, and add physical simulations. In this work, we propose a method to leverage the talent of traditionally trained hand animators to create three-dimensional animation of human motion, while allowing them to work in the medium that is familiar to them. The input to our algorithm is a set of hand-animated frames. Our key insight is to use motion capture data as a source of domain knowledge and 'lift' the two-dimensional animation to three dimensions, while maintaining the unique style of the input animation. A motion capture clip is projected to two dimensions. First, time alignment is done to match the timing of the hand-drawn frames and then, the limbs are aligned to better match the pose in the hand-drawn frames. Finally the motion is reconstructed in three dimensions. We demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of hand animated motion sequences on different characters, including ballet, a stylized sneaky walk, and a sequence of jumping jacks.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present a point-based method for animating incompressible flow. The advection term is handled by moving the sample points through the flow in a Lagrangian fashion. However, unlike most previous approaches, the pressure term is handled by performing a projection onto a divergence-free field. To perform the pressure projection, we compute a Voronoi diagram with the sample points as input. Borrowing from Finite Volume Methods, we then invoke the divergence theorem and ensure that each Voronoi cell is divergence free. To handle complex boundary conditions, Voronoi cells are clipped against obstacle boundaries and free surfaces. The method is stable, flexible and combines many of the desirable features of point-based and grid-based methods. We demonstrate our approach on several examples of splashing and streaming liquid and swirling smoke.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we explore the perception of finger motions of virtual characters. In three experiments, designed to investigate finger animations, we asked the following questions: When are errors in finger motion noticeable? What are the consequences of these errors? What animation method should we recommend? We found that synchronization errors of as little as 0.1s can be detected, but that the perceptibility of errors is highly dependent on the type of motion. Errors in finger animations can change the interpretation of a scene even without altering its perceived quality. Finally, out of the four conditions tested -- original motion capture, no motions, keyframed animation and randomly selected motions -- the original motion captured movements were rated as having the highest quality."

    :abstractText: We consume video content in a multitude of ways, including in movie theaters, on television, on DVDs and Blu-rays, online, on smart phones, and on portable media players. For quality control purposes, it is important to have a uniform viewing experience across these various platforms. In this work, we focus on voice synchronization, an aspect of video quality that is strongly affected by current post-production and transmission practices. We examined the synchronization of an actor's voice and lip movements in two distinct scenarios. First, we simulated the temporal mismatch between the audio and video tracks that can occur during dubbing or during broadcast. Next, we recreated the pitch changes that result from conversions between formats with different frame rates. We show, for the first time, that these audio visual mismatches affect viewer enjoyment. When temporal synchronization is noticeably absent, there is a decrease in the perceived performance quality and the perceived emotional intensity of a performance. For pitch changes, we find that higher pitch voices are not preferred, especially for male actors. Based on our findings, we advise that mismatched audio and video signals negatively affect viewer experience.

    :abstractText: "Virtual characters are much in demand for animated movies, games, and other applications. Rapid advances in performance capture and advanced rendering techniques have allowed the movie industry in particular to create characters that appear very human-like. However, with these new capabilities has come the realization that such characters are yet not quite &ldquo;right.&rdquo; One possible hypothesis is that these virtual humans fall into an &ldquo;Uncanny Valley&rdquo;, where the viewer's emotional response is repulsion or rejection, rather than the empathy or emotional engagement that their creators had hoped for. To explore these issues, we created three animated vignettes of an arguing couple with detailed motion for the face, eyes, hair, and body. In a set of perceptual experiments, we explore the relative importance of different anomalies using two different methods: a questionnaire to determine the emotional response to the full-length vignettes, with and without facial motion and audio; and a 2AFC (two alternative forced choice) task to compare the performance of a virtual &ldquo;actor&rdquo; in short clips (extracts from the vignettes) depicting a range of different facial and body anomalies. We found that the facial anomalies are particularly salient, even when very significant body animation anomalies are present."

    :abstractText: We present a technique for learning clothing models that enables the simultaneous animation of thousands of detailed garments in real-time. This surprisingly simple conditional model learns and preserves the key dynamic properties of a cloth motion along with folding details. Our approach requires no a priori physical model, but rather treats training data as a "black box." We show that the models learned with our method are stable over large time-steps and can approximately resolve cloth-body collisions. We also show that within a class of methods, no simpler model covers the full range of cloth dynamics captured by ours. Our method bridges the current gap between skinning and physical simulation, combining benefits of speed from the former with dynamic effects from the latter. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of apparel worn by male and female human characters performing a varied set of motions typically used in video games (e.g., walking, running, jumping, etc.).

    :abstractText: This paper presents design research conducted as part of a larger project on human-robot interaction. The primary goal of this study was to come to an initial understanding of what features and dimensions of a humanoid robot's face most dramatically contribute to people's perception of its humanness. To answer this question we analyzed 48 robots and conducted surveys to measure people's perception of each robot's humanness. Through our research we found that the presence of certain features, the dimensions of the head, and the total number of facial features heavily influence the perception of humanness in robot heads. This paper presents our findings and initial guidelines for the design of humanoid robot heads.

    :abstractText: MessyDesk is a replacement desktop that invites free-form decoration. MessyBoard is a large, projected, shared bulletin board that is decorated collaboratively by a small group of users.We built these programs with the goal of helping people remember more of the content that they access through a computer. Our approach is to embed content within distinct contexts. For instance, a computer with multiple projection screens could surround the user with panoramic vistas that correspond to projects that the user is working on. Since few people are willing to create their own context, we created MessyDesk and MessyBoard in order to entice people to decorate.Though we have not yet evaluated the impact of either program on users' memories, we have observed people using these programs over a several week period. From anecdotal evidence, we believe that MessyDesk may be a good tool for decoration and information management. MessyBoard became popular when we projected the board on the wall in our lab. We have seen that different research groups use it differently. One group uses it mostly for jokes and games, and another group uses it for long design discussions. It is good for scheduling, and supports factual as well as emotional communication among group members.

To understand experience and the user experience that results from interacting with products, designers conduct situated research activities focused on the interactions between people and products, and the experience that results. This paper attempts to clarify experience in interactive systems. We characterize current approaches to experience from a number of disciplines, and present a framework for designing experience for interactive system. We show how the framework can be applied by members of a multidisciplinary team to understand and generate the kinds of interactions and experiences new product and system designs might offer.

    :abstractText: Designers often borrow from the natural world to achieve pleasing, unobtrusive designs. We have extended this practice by combining living plants with sensors and lights in an interactive display, and by creating a robotic analogue that mimics phototropic behavior. In this paper, we document our design process and report the results of a 2-week field study. We put our living plant display, and its robotic counterpart, in a cafeteria between pairs of trash and recycling containers. Contributions of recyclables or trash triggered directional bursts of light that gradually induced the plant displays to lean toward the more active container. In interviews, people offered explanations for the displays and spoke of caring for the plants. A marginally significant increase in recycling behavior (p=.08) occurred at the display with living plants. Apparent increases also occurred at the robotic display and a unit with only lights. Our findings indicate value in exploring the use of living material and biomimetic forms in displays, and in using lightweight robotics to deliver simple rewards.

    :abstractText: Toolkits and other tools have dramatically reduced the time and technical expertise needed to design and implement graphical user interfaces (GUIs) allowing high-quality, iterative, user-centered design to become a common practice. Unfortunately the generation of functioning prototypes for physical interactive devices as not had similar support -- it still requires substantial time and effort by individuals with highly specialized skills and tools. This creates a divide between a designers' ability to explore form and interactivity of product designs and the ability to iterate on the basis of high fidelity interactive experiences with a functioning prototype. To help overcome this difficulty we have developed the Calder hardware toolkit. Calder is a development environment for rapidly exploring and prototyping functional physical interactive devices. Calder provides a set of reusable small input and output components, and integration into existing interface prototyping environments. These components communicate with a computer using wired and wireless connections. Calder is a tool targeted toward product and interaction designers to aid them in their early design process. In this paper we describe the process of gaining an understanding of the needs and workflow habits of our target users to generate a collection of requirements for such a toolkit. We describe technical challenges imposed by these needs, and the specifics of design and implementation of the toolkit to meet these challenges.

    :abstractText: Text-based interpersonal communication tools such as instant messenger are widely used today. These tools often feature emoticons that people use to express emotion to some degree. However, emoticons still lack the ability to communicate the details of an emotional response, such as the speaker's tone of voice or intensity of emotion. In this paper, we hypothesize that kinetic typography - text that moves or changes over time - can address some of this problem by enhancing emotional qualities of text communication using its dynamic and expressive properties.This paper presents a study showing that a small sample of designers can create kinetic effects that end-users could employ to consistently convey emotion. In the study, three designers prepared 24 kinetic examples expressing four different emotions. We found that the examples were rated quite consistently by 66 participants. These findings provide a preliminary indication that designers can create predefined kinetic effects which can be applied to a variety of textual messages, and that these effects will reliably convey a particular emotional intent. The findings from this study inform design guidelines for designing an instant messaging client that uses kinetic typography presentation.

    :abstractText: Office doors are more than entrances to rooms, they are entrances to a person's time and attention. People can mediate access to themselves by choosing whether to leave their door open or closed when they are in their office. Doors also serve as a medium for communication, where people can broadcast individual messages to passersby, or accept messages from others who stopped by when the door was closed. These qualities make the door an excellent location for designing solutions that help people better manage their time and attention. In this paper, we present a study of doors, derive design insights from the study, and then realize some of these insights in two cooperating implementations deployed in our workplace.

    :abstractText: In our increasingly decentralized world, demands to maintain relationships over long distances continue to increase. It is more and more difficult to maintain a sense of connection with others, to communicate with others in an emotionally rich way, and to know whether one is available for initiating a conversation in an appropriate context.This paper describes the design process and our solution to this challenge. The ComSlipper is a lightweight yet expressive sensible slipper that enhances the quality of computer-mediated relationships. The ComSlipper was developed using a human-centered design approach to better understand user behaviors and needs. The ComSlipper empowers the wearer to create a sense of connection to others. The wearer uses body gesture and tactile manipulation to feel and express emotions and availability to distant loved ones. The ComSlipper provides a natural and intimate way of communicating, and facilitates the development of intimate relationships.

    :abstractText: The increase in channels and formats of personal communication such as email, instant messaging, and mobile phones, has generated new problems both with selecting the appropriate method to contact someone and communicating a preference for incoming communication. Some applications, such as instant messaging have partially addressed this problem with status and away messages, but this approach offers limited communication options and only works for this communication channel. Following a user-centered design approach, we explored the needs of users to manage their communication channels. Using diaries, observations, and directed story-telling interviews we generated a set of observed needs. We then generated concept scenarios that capture these needs and performed a concept validation with a focus group looking for an overlap between our observed needs and the focus groups perceived needs. This paper documents our findings and offers implications for designers addressing these communication needs.

    :abstractText: Kinetic (dynamic) typography has demonstrated the ability to add significant emotive content and appeal to expressive text, allowing some of the qualities normally found in film and the spoken word to be added to static text. Kinetic typography has been widely and successfully used in film title sequences as well as television and computer-based advertising. However, its communicative abilities have not been widely studied, and its potential has rarely been exploited outside these areas. This is partly due to the difficulty in creating kinetic typography with current tools, often requiring hours of work to animate a single sentence.In this paper, we present the Kinedit system, a basic authoring tool that takes initial steps toward remedying this situation and hence promoting exploration of the communicative potential of kinetic typography for personal communication. Kinedit is informed by systematic study and characterization of a corpus of examples, and iterative involvement and validation by designers throughout the development process. We describe the tool and its underlying technology, usage experiences, lessons learned, and next steps.

    :abstractText: A person seeking someone else's attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible they are. This assessment allows for behavior we perceive as natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. On the other hand, today's computer systems are almost entirely oblivious to the human world they operate in, and typically have no way to take into account the interruptibility of the user. This paper presents a Wizard of Oz study exploring whether, and how, robust sensor-based predictions of interruptibility might be constructed, which sensors might be most useful to such predictions, and how simple such sensors might be.The study simulates a range of possible sensors through human coding of audio and video recordings. Experience sampling is used to simultaneously collect randomly distributed self-reports of interruptibility. Based on these simulated sensors, we construct statistical models predicting human interruptibility and compare their predictions with the collected self-report data. The results of these models, although covering a demographically limited sample, are very promising, with the overall accuracy of several models reaching about 78%. Additionally, a model tuned to avoiding unwanted interruptions does so for 90% of its predictions, while retaining 75% overall accuracy.

    :abstractText: In this paper we describe the Sense Lounger, a method for simply and cheaply turning a lounge chair into an initial "ubicomp" device in a home; providing a beachhead for transforming the home into a rich ubicomp environment. The Sense Lounger employs fabric sensors sewn into a chair's slipcover and force sensors on each leg to detect both an occupant and their activity. Drawing insights from user needs, we developed the Sense Lounger to (i) fit into the home and lifestyle of elders, (ii) assist and add value to the lives of elders, (iii) provide a platform for expanding assistive devices within the home environment. The current Sense Lounger prototype can be used to detect signs of life, patterns of use, posture, and sitting duration.

    :abstractText: We present Breakaway, an ambient display that encourages people, whose job requires them to sit for long periods of time, to take breaks more frequently. Breakaway uses the information from sensors placed on an office chair to communicate in a non-obtrusive manner how long the user has been sitting. Breakaway is a small sculpture placed on the desk. Its design is inspired by animation arts and theater, which rely heavily on body language to express emotions. Its shape and movement reflect the form of the human body; an upright position reflecting the body's refreshed pose, and a slouching position reflecting the body's pose after sitting for a long time. An initial evaluation shows a correlation between the movement of the sculpture and when participants took breaks, suggesting that ambient displays that make use of aesthetic and lifelike form might be promising for making positive changes in human behavior.

Some of the most serious of these are shrinking social connections, limitations in building new relationships, and diminished health. To address these issues, we have designed an augmented dancing environment that allows elders to select dance sequences from well-known movies and dance along with them. The goal of DanceAlong is twofold: (1) to provide entertainment and exercise for each individual user and (2) to promote social engagement within the group. We deployed DanceAlong in a cultural celebration at a senior community center and conducted evaluations. In this paper, we present the design process of DanceAlong, evaluations of DanceAlong, and design guidelines for creating similar interactive systems for the elderly."

    :abstractText: In-vehicle navigation has changed substantially in recent years, due to the advent of computer generated maps and directions. However, these maps are still problematic, due to a mismatch between the complexity of the maps and the attentional demands of driving. In response to this problem, we are developing the MOVE (Maps Optimized for Vehicular Environments) system. This system will provide situationally appropriate map information by presenting information that uses appropriate amounts of the driver's attention. In this paper, we describe our findings of studies to help shape the design of the MOVE system, including studies on map reading and in-vehicle navigation, and studies on the effectiveness of a variety of contextually optimized route map visualizations in a simulated driving context.Results show that contextually optimized displays designed for the MOVE system should significantly reduce perceptual load in the context of driving. In our laboratory experiment there was a six-fold decrease in the total map display fixation time and nearly threefold decrease in the number of glances needed to interpret the contextually optimized display compared to a static display.

While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research."

    :abstractText: Advances in technology continually increase the ability, but also the complexity of consumer electronics. This is especially true when several devices must be configured to work together, such as a digital TV and satellite box. Manufacturers of consumer electronics attempt to remedy this by designing interfaces that consolidate multiple, complex user interfaces into a single, simple interface. However, the problem remains that end-users are still expected to configure and learn to operate these new interfaces on their own. This paper addresses the problem by proposing a radically new goal in terms of user interfaces for in-home, networked consumer electronics. Instead of trying and failing to make interfaces simple enough for everyone to use, we propose making interfaces that allow a "technology lead" - the person in the family responsible for supporting the technology-to more easily administer devices in his or her own home and in the homes of other family members. In Japan, where this study is taking place, user-centered research methods show that families usually have a single technology lead who is challenged with supporting people remotely in several homes. By enabling the technology lead to remotely support family members at a distance, the natural family dynamic can be used to support users who either find the new breed of consumer electronics too difficult to learn or do not wish to invest the time to learn how they work.

    :abstractText: "A recent trend in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research addresses human needs that go beyond the instrumental, resulting in an increasing body of knowledge about how users form overall evaluative judgments on the quality of interactive products. An aspect largely neglected so far is that of temporality, i.e. how the quality of users' experience develops over time. This paper presents an in-depth, five-week ethnographic study that followed 6 individuals during an actual purchase of the Apple iPhone\". We found prolonged use to be motivated by different qualities than the ones that provided positive initial experiences. Overall, while early experiences seemed to relate mostly to hedonic aspects of product use, prolonged experiences became increasingly more tied to aspects reflecting how the product becomes meaningful in one's life. Based on the findings, we promote three directions for CHI practice: designing for meaningful mediation, designing for daily rituals, and designing for the self."

We believe that by better understanding people's functional and emotional relationships to existing products, we might better understand how to design future products. This paper presents the Perceptive Sorting exercise (PS), a method inspired by the field of visual research to gain responses to product familiarity, product function, and aesthetic considerations. We report on a study using the PS with coffeemakers, watches, and consumer robotic products. The results provided information about how participants assess product attributes, assign value, and tell stories of product use.

From an interaction design perspective, little is known about how to specifically design an embodied agent to support the task it will perform and the social interactions that will result. This paper presents design research that explores the relationship between the visual features of embodied agents and the tasks they perform, and the social attributions that result. Our results show a clear link between agent task and agent form and reveals that people often prefer agents who conform to gender stereotypes associated with tasks. Based on the results of this work, we provide a set of emerging design considerations to help guide interaction designers in creating the visual form of embodied agents.

    :abstractText: Technology increasingly mediates communication between people, particularly when they live at a distance. For couples in long-distance relationships, these technologies are a primary means of exchanging not only information but also emotions. This one-year project explores the communication needs of couples living at a distance to design an intimate and emotional means of interaction specifically for this context. A user-centered design process revealed opportunities for interactions that show time and effort or those that connect people through a shared sense of place. These observed needs were used to develop concepts which where validated by representative users.

    :abstractText: People consider other people who resemble them to be more persuasive. Users may consider embodied conversational agents, or ECAs, to be more persuasive if the agents resemble them. In an experimental study, we found that users rated the persuasiveness of agents that resemble them higher than other agents. However, actual advice-taking diverged from this pattern; when users created the agents, users changed their choices less when interacting with the agents that resembled them. We conducted a follow-up study and found that resemblance and self-esteem affect interactions with agents that resemble users. We discuss the use of self-report and behavioral data in evaluations of agent interfaces and how agents that resemble users might foster particular social interactions with a system. We suggest that agents that resemble users may be more persuasive in advising users about their actions and decisions.

    :abstractText: Experience sampling method (or ESM) is a common data collection method to understand user behavior and to evaluate ubiquitous computing technologies. However, ESM studies often demand too much time and commitment from participants, which leads to attrition and low compliance among participants. We introduce a new approach called experience sampling with feedback or ES+feedback that improves compliance by giving feedback to participants through various visualizations. Providing feedback to users makes the information personally relevant and increases the value of the study to participants, which increases their compliance. Our exploratory study shows that ES+feedback increases the compliance rate by 23%.

    :abstractText: Normally, the primary purpose of an information display is to convey information. If information displays can be aesthetically interesting, that might be an added bonus. This paper considers an experiment in reversing this imperative. It describes the Kandinsky system which is designed to create displays which are first aesthetically interesting, and then as an added bonus, able to convey information. The Kandinsky system works on the basis of aesthetic properties specified by an artist (in a visual form). It then explores a space of collages composed from information bearing images, using an optimization technique to find compositions which best maintain the properties of the artist's aesthetic expression.

    :abstractText: In order to create and use rich custom appearances, designers are often forced to introduce an unnatural gap into the design process. For example, a designer creating a skin for a music player must separately specify the appearance of the elements in the music player skin and the mapping between these visual elements and the functionality provided by the music player. This gap between appearance and semantic meaning creates a number of problems. We present a set of techniques that allows designers to use their preferred drawing tool to specify both appearance and semantic meaning. We demonstrate our techniques in an unmodified version of Adobe Photoshop&reg;, but our techniques are general and adaptable to nearly any layered drawing package.

    :abstractText: Kinetic typography --- text that uses movement or other temporal change --- has recently emerged as a new form of communication. As we hope to illustrate in this paper, kinetic typography can be seen as bringing some of the expressive power of film --- such as its ability to convey emotion, portray compelling characters, and visually direct attention --- to the strong communicative properties of text. Although kinetic typography offers substantial promise for expressive communications, it has not been widely exploited outside a few limited application areas (most notably in TV advertising). One of the reasons for this has been the lack of tools directly supporting it, and the accompanying difficulty in creating dynamic text. This paper presents a first step in remedying this situation --- an extensible and robust system for animating text in a wide variety of forms. By supporting an appropriate set of carefully factored abstractions, this engine provides a relatively small set of components that can be plugged together to create a wide range of different expressions. It provides new techniques for automating effects used in traditional cartoon animation, and provides specific support for typographic manipulations.

    :abstractText: The proliferation of wireless handheld devices is placing the World Wide Web in the palms of users, but this convenience comes at a high interactive cost. The Web that came of age on the desktop is ill-suited for use on the small displays of handhelds. Today, handheld browsing often feels like browsing on a PC with a shrunken desktop. Overreliance on scrolling is a big problem in current handheld browsing. Users confined to viewing a small portion of each page often lack a sense of the overall context --- they may feel lost in a large page and be forced to remember the locations of items as those items scroll out of view. In this paper, we present a synthesis of interaction techniques to address these problems. We implemented these techniques in a prototype, WebThumb, that can browse the live Web.

    :abstractText: This paper reports on the results of a long-term experiment in which a social robot's facial expressions were changed to reflect different moods. While the facial changes in each condition were not extremely different, they still altered how people interacted with the robot. On days when many visitors were present, average interactions with the robot were longer when the robot displayed either a "happy" or a "sad" expression instead of a neutral face, but the opposite was true for low-visitor days. The implications of these findings for human-robot social interaction are discussed.

    :abstractText: "We are developing robots with socially appropriate spatial skills not only to travel around or near people, but also to accompany people side-by-side. As a step toward this goal, we are investigating the social perceptions of a robot's movement as it follows behind a person. This paper discusses our laser-based person-tracking method and two different approaches to person-following: direction-following and path-following. While both algorithms have similar characteristics in terms of tracking performance and following distances, participants in a pilot study rated the direction-following behavior as significantly more human-like and natural than the path-following behavior. We argue that the path-following method may still be more appropriate in some situations, and we propose that the ideal person-following behavior may be a hybrid approach, with the robot automatically selecting which method to use."

    :abstractText: Robots that work with people foster social relationships between people and systems. The home is an interesting place to study the adoption and use of these systems. The home provides challenges from both technical and interaction perspectives. In addition, the home is a seat for many specialized human behaviors and needs, and has a long history of what is collected and used to functionally, aesthetically, and symbolically fit the home. To understand the social impact of robotic technologies, this paper presents an ethnographic study of consumer robots in the home. Six families' experience of floor cleaning after receiving a new vacuum (a Roomba robotic vacuum or the Flair, a handheld upright) was studied. While the Flair had little impact, the Roomba changed people, cleaning activities, and other product use. In addition, people described the Roomba in aesthetic and social terms. The results of this study, while initial, generate implications for how robots should be designed for the home.

    :abstractText: "Domestic service robots have long been a staple of science fiction and commercial visions of the future. Until recently, we have only been able to speculate about what the experience of using such a device might be. Current domestic service robots, introduced as consumer products, allow us to make this vision a reality.This paper presents ethnographic research on the actual use of these products, to provide a grounded understanding of how design can influence human-robot interaction in the home. We used an ecological approach to broadly explore the use of this technology in this context, and to determine how an autonomous, mobile robot might \"fit\" into such a space. We offer initial implications for the design of these products: first, the way the technology is introduced is critical; second, the use of the technology becomes social; and third, that ideally, homes and domestic service robots must adapt to each other."

    :abstractText: Robots are becoming increasingly integrated into the workplace, impacting organizational structures and processes, and affecting products and services created by these organizations. While robots promise significant benefits to organizations, their introduction poses a variety of design challenges. In this paper, we use ethnographic data collected at a hospital using an autonomous delivery robot to examine how organizational factors affect the way its members respond to robots and the changes engendered by their use. Our analysis uncovered dramatic differences between the medical and post-partum units in how people integrated the robot into their workflow and their perceptions of and interactions with it. Different patient profiles in these units led to differences in workflow, goals, social dynamics, and the use of the physical environment. In medical units, low tolerance for interruptions, a discrepancy between the perceived cost and benefits of using the robot, and breakdowns due to high traffic and clutter in the robot's path caused the robot to have a negative impact on the workflow and staff resistance. On the contrary, post-partum units integrated the robot into their workflow and social context. Based on our findings, we provide design guidelines for the development of robots for organizations.

    :abstractText: Drivers need assistance when navigating an unfamiliar route. In-vehicle navigation systems have improved in recent years due to the technology advances, but are sometimes problematic because of information overload while driving. To address the attentional demands of reading a map while driving, we have developed the maps optimized for vehicular environments (MOVE) in-car navigation display, which provides situationally appropriate navigation information to the driver through optimization of map information. In this paper, we describe the iterative design and evaluation process that shaped the MOVE system. We describe early map reading and navigation studies that led to early designs for our system. We present a study on visual search tasks that refined the renditions used for the system. Finally, we present a study on the effectiveness of several variations of a contextually optimized route map visualization with a desktop steering system. The result of this study shows that MOVE's contextually optimized navigation information can reduce the driver's perceptual load significantly. Our laboratory experiment shows that the total map display fixation time was decreased six-fold, and the number of glances to interpret the map display were decreased about threefold, when comparing the contextually optimized display to a static display.

    :abstractText: A person seeking another person's attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible the other person currently is. Such assessments allow behavior that we consider natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. This is in sharp contrast to current computer and communication systems, which are largely unaware of the social situations surrounding their usage and the impact that their actions have on these situations. If systems could model human interruptibility, they could use this information to negotiate interruptions at appropriate times, thus improving human computer interaction.This article presents a series of studies that quantitatively demonstrate that simple sensors can support the construction of models that estimate human interruptibility as well as people do. These models can be constructed without using complex sensors, such as vision-based techniques, and therefore their use in everyday office environments is both practical and affordable. Although currently based on a demographically limited sample, our results indicate a substantial opportunity for future research to validate these results over larger groups of office workers. Our results also motivate the development of systems that use these models to negotiate interruptions at socially appropriate times.

    :abstractText: One of the problems with empathic research methods in interaction design is that the leap between findings about people and design is often left undocumented. In this paper, we describe a microsketching, a method for producing rapid concept sketches that emphasizes creative exploration of the aesthetic and interactive possibilities of the individual elements of a technology, rather than seeking to develop a complete product. We discuss the use of microsketching within the design process, and provide a case study of its use with an experienced designer and in a design studio course. We discuss how microsketching can be used to scaffold the leap between data collection and design, to quickly introduce designers outside of the research team to the elements of the design problem, and to teach novice interaction designers how to design the interface and interaction for complex products and systems.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a method for improving the runtime of an optimal heuristic path planner (A*) so that it can run repeatedly, in real-time, in a dynamic environment. This is necessary for mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments that have moving obstacles with associated costs, such as personal space around people or buffer zones around dangerous vehicles. Our approach is to modify the search space used by the A* algorithm, increasing the size of grid cells further from the robot. This approach relies on the notion that only the area closest to the robot needs to be searched carefully; areas further from the robot can be searched more coarsely. Because the planner is assumed to run repeatedly as the robot moves, the robot will always have a fine-grained path defined for its next action. We have experimentally verified in simulation that this algorithm can be run in real-time and produces paths that are comparable to full-resolution planning.

    :abstractText: "The mental structures that people apply towards other people have been shown to influence the way people cooperate with others. These mental structures or schemas evoke behavioral scripts. In this paper, we explore two different scripts, receptionist and information kiosk, that we propose channeled visitors' interactions with an interactive robot. We analyzed visitors' typed verbal responses to a receptionist robot in a university building. Half of the visitors greeted the robot (e.g., \"hello\") prior to interacting with it. Greeting the robot significantly predicted a more social script: more relational conversational strategies such as sociable interaction and politeness, attention to the robot's narrated stories, self-disclosure, and less negative/rude behaviors. The findings suggest people's first words in interaction can predict their schematic orientation to an agent, making it possible to design agents that adapt to individuals during interaction. We propose designs for interactive computational agents that can elicit people's cooperation."

    :abstractText: "People strive to obtain self-knowledge. A class of systems called personal informatics is appearing that help people collect and reflect on personal information. However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value of systems."

    :abstractText: "The design of in-vehicle navigation systems fails to take into account the social nature of driving and automobile navigation. In this paper, we consider navigation as a social activity among drivers and navigators to improve design of such systems. We explore the implications of moving from a map-centered, individually-focused design paradigm to one based upon collaborative human interaction during the navigation task. We conducted a qualitative interaction design study of navigation among three types of teams: parents and their teenage children, couples, and unacquainted individuals. We found that collaboration varied among these different teams, and was influenced by social role, as well as the task role of driver or navigator. We also found that patterns of prompts, maneuvers, and confirmations varied among the three teams. We identify overarching practices that differ greatly from the literature on individual navigation. From these discoveries, we present design implications that can be used to inform future navigation systems."

    :abstractText: People strive to gain better knowledge of themselves by collecting information about their behaviors, habits, and thoughts. Personal informatics systems can help by facilitating the collection of personal information and the reflection on that information. These systems satisfy people's innate curiosity about themselves and encourage holistic engagement with one's life. Development of such systems poses new challenges in human-computer interaction and opens opportunities for new applications and collaborations between diverse disciplines, such as design, life-logging, ubiquitous computing, persuasive technologies, and information visualization.

    :abstractText: Robots that operate in the real world will make mistakes. Thus, those who design and build systems will need to understand how best to provide ways for robots to mitigate those mistakes. Building on diverse research literatures, we consider how to mitigate breakdowns in services provided by robots. Expectancy-setting strategies forewarn people of a robot's limitations so people will expect mistakes. Recovery strategies, including apologies, compensation, and options for the user, aim to reduce the negative consequence of breakdowns. We tested these strategies in an online scenario study with 317 participants. A breakdown in robotic service had severe impact on evaluations of the service and the robot, but forewarning and recovery strategies reduced the negative impact of the breakdown. People's orientation toward services influenced which recovery strategy worked best. Those with a relational orientation responded best to an apology; those with a utilitarian orientation responded best to compensation. We discuss robotic service design to mitigate service problems.

    :abstractText: For human-robot interaction to proceed in a smooth, natural manner, robots must adhere to human social norms. One such human convention is the use of expressive moods and emotions as an integral part of social interaction. Such expressions are used to convey messages such as ''I'm happy to see you'' or ''I want to be comforted,'' and people's long-term relationships depend heavily on shared emotional experiences. Thus, we have developed an affective model for social robots. This generative model attempts to create natural, human-like affect and includes distinctions between immediate emotional responses, the overall mood of the robot, and long-term attitudes toward each visitor to the robot, with a focus on developing long-term human-robot relationships. This paper presents the general affect model as well as particular details of our implementation of the model on one robot, the Roboceptionist. In addition, we present findings from two studies that demonstrate the model's potential.

    :abstractText: Designers generally agree that understanding the context of use is important in designing products. However, technologically advanced products such as personal robots engender complex contextual characteristics that are not yet well understood. The social context of use shapes the roles that the user and the product play in the interaction. For instance, an intelligent agent that acts as a coach for an exercise program and one that supervises a physical rehabilitation regimen for the physically challenged function in different social contexts. Only a few studies to date have considered the social context of use as part of the design. My research proposes a conceptual framework for understanding the critical social aspects of interaction with products such as the social context of use. I combine interaction design and social science methodology to make an evaluation of my framework with a series of empirical studies.

    :abstractText: "Non-verbal behavior, particularly gaze, is a crucial part of human communication. To interact with humans in a rich, natural way, social interfaces need to use this communicative channel effectively. While the role and mechanics of human gaze are extensively studied, how gaze might be used effectively by embodied interfaces is not well explored. The goal of my dissertation is to gain a deeper understanding of how gaze behavior affects people's interactions with embodied social interfaces and how we can design gaze for effective communication. This research focuses on four main social functions of gaze: Regulation, Expression, Establishing Joint Attention, and Initiating/Avoiding of Social Encounters and four sets of design variables: Temporal, Spatial, Physiological, and Contextual. A systematic study of how these functions and design variables affect each other is conducted through a series of empirical studies."

    :abstractText: "During conversations, speakers establish their and others' participant roles (who participates in the conversation and in what capacity)--or \"footing\" as termed by Goffman-using gaze cues. In this paper, we study how a robot can establish the participant roles of its conversational partners using these cues. We designed a set of gaze behaviors for Robovie to signal three kinds of participant roles: addressee, bystander, and overhearer. We evaluated our design in a controlled laboratory experiment with 72 subjects in 36 trials. In three conditions, the robot signaled to two subjects, only by means of gaze, the roles of (1) two addressees, (2) an addressee and a bystander, or (3) an addressee and an overhearer. Behavioral measures showed that subjects' participation behavior conformed to the roles that the robot communicated to them. In subjective evaluations, significant differences were observed in feelings of groupness between addressees and others and liking between overhearers and others. Participation in the conversation did not affect task performance-measured by recall of information presented by the robot-but affected subjects' ratings of how much they attended to the task."

    :abstractText: Human communication involves a number of nonverbal cues that are seemingly unintentional, unconscious, and automatic-both in their production and perception-and convey rich information on the emotional state and intentions of an individual. One family of such cues is called "nonverbal leakage." In this paper, we explore whether people can read nonverbal leakage cues-particularly gaze cues-in humanlike robots and make inferences on robots' intentions, and whether the physical design of the robot affects these inferences. We designed a gaze cue for Geminoid-a highly humanlike android-and Robovie-a robot with stylized, abstract humanlike features-that allowed the robots to "leak" information on what they might have in mind. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we asked participants to play a game of guessing with either of the robots and evaluated how the gaze cue affected participants' task performance. We found that the gaze cue did, in fact, lead to better performance, from which we infer that the cue led to attributions of mental states and intentionality. Our results have implications for robot design, particularly for designing expression of intentionality, and for our understanding of how people respond to human social cues when they are enacted by robots.

    :abstractText: The kinematic chain is a ubiquitous and extensively studied representation in robotics as well as a useful model for studying the motion of biological macro-molecules. Both fields stand to benefit from algorithms for efficient maintenance and collision detection in such chains. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical representation of a kinematic chain allowing for efficient incremental updates and relative position calculation. A hierarchy of oriented bounding boxes is superimposed on this representation, enabling high performance collision detection, self-collision testing, and distance computation. This representation has immediate applications in the field of molecular biology, for speeding up molecular simulations and studies of folding paths of proteins. It could be instrumental in path planning applications for robots with many degrees of freedom, also known as hyper-redundant robots. A comparison of the performance of the algorithm with the current state of the art in collision detection is presented for a number of benchmarks.

    :abstractText: "Path planning has been widely studied by computer scientists. However, it is a very simplified version of the motion planning problems occurring in robotics. This paper examines extensions yielding two important issues: controllability and recognizability. The controllability issue arises when the number of controls is smaller than the number of independent parameters defining the robot's configuration: Can the motions span the configuration space? The recognizability issue occurs when there are errors in control and sensing: Can the robot recognize goal achievement? Both issues have interesting impact on the computational complexity of motion planning. This paper will also discuss a new path planning scheme based on random sampling of configuration space, to deal with many-degree-of-freedom robots. The blend of controllability, recognizability, and complexity issues discussed in this paper is unique to robotics and its study is key to the development of autonomous robots."

    :abstractText: In a constantly changing and partially unpredictable environment, robot motion planning must be on-line. The planner receives a continuous flow of information about occurring events and generates new plans, while previously planned motions are being executed. This paper describes an on-line planner for two cooperating arms whose task is to grab parts of various types on a conveyor belt and transfer them to their respective goals while avoiding collision with obstacles. Parts arrive on the belt in random order, at any time. Both goals and obstacles may be dynamically changed. This scenario is typical of manufacturing cells serving machine-tools, assembling products, or packaging objects. The proposed approach breaks the overall planning problem into subproblems, each involving a low-dimensional configuration or configuration-time space, and orchestrates very fast primitives solving these subproblems. The resulting planner has been implemented and extensively tested in a simulated environment, as well as with a real dual-arm system. Its competitiveness has been evaluated against an oracle making (almost) the best decision at any one time; the results show that the planner compares extremely well.

    :abstractText: Stereotaxic radiosurgery is a procedure which uses a beam of radiation as an ablative surgical instrument to destroy brain tumors. The beam is produced by a linear accelerator which is moved by a jointed mechanism. Radiation is concentrated by crossfiring at the tumor from multiple directions and the amount of energy deposited in normal brain tissues is reduced. Because access to the tumor is obstructed along some directions by critical regions (e.g., brainstem, optic nerves) and most tumors are not shaped like spheres, planning the path of the beam is often difficult and time-consuming. This paper describes a computer-based planner developed to assist the surgeon generate a satisfactory path, given the spatial distribution of the brain tissues obtained with medical imaging. Experimental results with the implemented planner are presented, including a comparison with manually generated paths. According to these results, automatic planning significantly improves energy deposition. It can also shorten the overall treatment, hence reducing the patient''s pain and allowing the radiosurgery equipment to be used for more patients. Stereotaxic radiosurgery is an example of so-called "bloodless surgery". Computer-based planning techniques are expected to facilitate further development of this safer, less painful, and more cost effective type of surgery.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we describe a plan generator for planning the sequence of machining cuts of mechanical parts. This system, named GARI, makes use of weighted pieces of advice representing the expertise of human specialists. The complexity of the application domain guided us toward the implementation of a rather sophisticated control structure including hypothesis generation, fact deduction, and conflict resolution. Experiments with GARI suggest that more research effort should be devoted to abstract representation of control as opposed to the exhaustive representations defended by several authors during the last few years.

    :abstractText: Tracking a partially predictable moving object in a workspace cluttered by obstacles is a challenging combination of two planning problems. The planner must take into account on the one hand the visibility and motion constraints imposed by the obstacles and on the other hand the uncertainties in both the robot's position and the future trajectory of the target. Game theory is proposed as an appropriate framework to solve this twofold problem. At each time step, a probability distribution models the positioning uncertainties of the robot and the target and a utility function represents the reward associated with the possible goal states of the motion decision problem. This approach allows the simple modeling of different tracking strategies, one of which has been implemented and tested successfully with two mobile robots. By considering simultaneously target visibility and position uncertainty, the tracking robot can take advantage of landmarks scattered in the workspace to better localize itself so as to better track the target afterward. Future extensions seem possible in order to introduce useful symbolic inferences within the game-theoretic framework.

    :abstractText: "We present a brief overview of an algorithm for interactively animating object grasping and manipulation tasks for human figures. The technique is designed to efficiently generate feasible single-arm manipulation motions given high-level task commands. For moving an object, the motions necessary for a human arm to reach and grasp the object, reposition it, and return the arm to rest are generated automatically within a few seconds on average. The method synthesizes motion \xC2\xBFon-the-fly\xC2\xBF by directly searching the configuration space of the arm. Goal configurations for the arm are computed using an inverse kinematics algorithm that attempts to select a natural posture. A collision-free trajectory connecting the arm initial configuration to the goal configuration is computed using a randomized path planner. A high-level description of the methods is given along with results from some computed examples using a human character model."

    :abstractText: Classic techniques for simulating molecular motion, such as the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics methods, generate individual motion pathways one at a time and spend most of their time trying to escape from the local minima of the energy landscape of a molecule. Their high computational cost prevents them from being used to analyze many pathways. We introduce Stochustic Roadmap Sirrrcllation (SRS), a new approach for exploring the kinetics of molecular motion by simultaneously examining multiple pathways encoded compactly in a graph, called a roadmap. A roadmap is computed by sampling a molecule's conformation space at random. The computation does not suffer from the localminima problem encountered with existing methods. Each path in the roadmap represents a potential motion pathway and is associated with a probability indicating the likelihood that the molecule follows this pathway. By viewing the roadmap as a Markov chain, we can efficiently compute kinetic properties of molecular motion over the entire molecular energy landscape. We also prove that, in the limit, SRS converges to the same distribution as Monte Carlo simulation. To test the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to the computation of the transmission coefficients for protein folding, an important order parameter that measures the "kinetic distance" of a protein's conformation to its native state Our computational studies show that SRS obtains more accurate results and achieves several orders- of- magnitude reduction in computation time, compared with Monte Carlo simulatio.

    :abstractText: We apply manipulation planning to computer animation. A new path planner is presented that automatically computes the collision-free trajectories for several cooperating arms to manipulate a movable object between two configurations. This implemented planner is capable of dealing with complicated tasks where regrasping is involved. In addition, we present a new inverse kinematics algorithm for the human arms. This algorithm is utilized by the planner for the generation of realistic human arm motions as they manipulate objects. We view our system as a tool for facilitating the production of animation.

    :abstractText: Why is probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planning probabilistic? How does the probability measure used for sampling a robot's configuration space affect the performance of a PRM planner? These questions have received little attention to date. This paper tries to fill this gap and identify promising directions to improve future planners. It introduces the probabilistic foundations of PRM planning and examines previous work in this context. It shows that the success of PRM planning depends mainly and critically on favorable "visibility" properties of a robot's configuration space. A promising direction for speeding up PRM planners is to infer partial knowledge of such properties from both workspace geometry and information gathered during roadmap construction, and to use this knowledge to adapt the probability measure for sampling. This paper also shows that the choice of the sampling source--pseudo-random or deterministic--has small impact on a PRM planner's performance, compared with that of the sampling measure. These conclusions are supported by both theoretical and empirical results.

    :abstractText: Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) have been successfully used to plan complex robot motions in configuration spaces of small and large dimensionalities. However, their efficiency decreases dramatically in spaces with narrow passages. This paper presents a new method--small-step retraction--that helps PRM planners find paths through such passages. This method consists of slightly "fattening" robot's free space, constructing a roadmap in fattened free space, and finally repairing portions of this roadmap by retracting them out of collision into actual free space. Fattened free space is not explicitly computed. Instead, the geometric models of workspace objects (robot links and/or obstacles) are "thinned" around their medial axis. A robot configuration lies in fattened free space if the thinned objects do not collide at this configuration. Two repair strategies are proposed. The "optimist" strategy waits until a complete path has been found in fattened free space before repairing it. Instead, the "pessimist" strategy repairs the roadmap as it is being built. The former is usually very fast, but may fail in some pathological cases. The latter is more reliable, but not as fast. A simple combination of the two strategies yields an integrated planner that is both fast and reliable. This planner was implemented as an extension of a pre-existing single-query PRM planner. Comparative tests show that it is significantly faster (sometimes by several orders of magnitude) than the pre-existing planner.

    :abstractText: Cognitive informatics (CI) is the transdisciplinary enquiry of cognitive and information sciences that investigates into the internal information processing mechanisms and processes of the brain and natural intelligence, and their engineering applications via an interdisciplinary approach. CI develops a coherent set of fundamental theories and denotational mathematics, which form the foundation for most information and knowledge based science and engineering disciplines such as computer science, cognitive science, neuropsychology, systems science, cybernetics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and computational intelligence. This paper reviews the central doctrine of CI and its applications. The theoretical framework of CI is described on the architecture of CI and its denotational mathematic means. A set of theories and formal models of CI is presented in order to explore the natural and computational intelligence. A wide range of applications of CI are described in the areas of cognitive computers, cognitive properties of knowledge, simulations of human cognitive behaviors, cognitive complexity of software, autonomous agent systems, and computational intelligence.

    :abstractText: Why is probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planning probabilistic? How does the probability measure used for sampling a robot's configuration space affect the performance of a PRM planner? These questions have received little attention to date. This paper tries to fill this gap and identify promising directions to improve future planners. It introduces the probabilistic foundations of PRM planning and examines previous work in this context. It shows that the success of PRM planning depends mainly and critically on favorable "visibility" properties of a robot's configuration space. A promising direction for speeding up PRM planners is to infer partial knowledge of such properties from both workspace geometry and information gathered during roadmap construction, and to use this knowledge to adapt the probability measure for sampling. This paper also shows that the choice of the sampling source--pseudo-random or deterministic--has small impact on a PRM planner's performance, compared with that of the sampling measure. These conclusions are supported by both theoretical and empirical results.

    :abstractText: "In this paper we consider a motion planning problem that occurs in tasks such as spot welding, car painting, inspection, and measurement, where the end-effector of a robotic arm must reach successive goal placements given as inputs. The problem is to compute a nearoptimal path of the arm so that the end-effector visits each goal once. It combines two notoriously hard subproblems: the collisionfree shortest-path and the traveling-salesman problems. It is further complicated by the fact that each goal placement of the end-effector may be achieved by several configurations of the arm (distinct solutions of the arm's inverse kinematics). This leads to considering a set of goal configurations of the robot that are partitioned into groups. The planner must compute a robot path that visits one configuration in each group and is near optimal over all configurations in every goal group and over all group orderings. The algorithm described in this paper operates under the assumption that finding a good tour in a graph with edges of given costs takes much less time than computing good paths between all pairs of goal configurations from different groups. So, the algorithm balances the time spent in computing paths between goal configurations and the time spent in computing tours. Although the algorithm still computes a quadratic number of such paths in the worst case, experimental results show that it is much faster in practice."

    :abstractText: "Inspired by the success of the distributed computing community in apply logics of knowledge and time to reasoning about distributed protocols, we aim for a similarly powerful and high-level abstraction when reasoning about control problems involving uncertainty. This paper concentrates on robot motion planning with uncertainty in both control and sensing, a problem that has already been well studied within the robotics community. First, a new and natural problem in this domain is defined: does there exists a sound and complete termination condition for a motion, given initial and goal locations? If yes, how to construct it? Then we define a high-level language, a logic of time and knowledge, which we use to reason about termination conditions and to state general conditions for the existence of sound and complete termination conditions in a broad domain. Finally, we show that sound termination conditions that are optimal in a precise sense provide a natural example of knowledge-based programs with multiple implementations."

    :abstractText: Failures in mobile robot navigation are often caused by errors in localizing the robot relative to its environment. This paper explores the idea that these errors can be considerably reduced by planning paths taking the robot through positions where pertinent features of the environment can be sensed. It introduces the notion of a "sensory uncertainty field" (SUF). For every possible robot configuration q, this field estimates the distribution of possible errors in the robot configuration that would be computed by a localization function matching the data given by the sensors against an environment model, if the robot was at q. A planner is proposed which uses a precomputed SUF to generate paths that minimize expected errors or any other criterion combining, say, path length and errors. This paper describes in detail the computation of a specific SUF for a mobile robot equipped with a classical line-striping camera/laser range sensor. It presents an implemented SUF-based motion planner for this robot and shows paths generated by this planner. Navigation experiments were conducted with mobile robots using paths generated by the SUF-based planner and other paths. The former paths were tracked with greater precision than the others. The final section of the paper discusses additional research issues related to SUF-based planning.

    :abstractText: Several applications in biology - e.g., incorporation of protein flexibility in ligand docking algorithms, interpretation of fuzzy X-ray crystallographic data, and homology modeling - require computing the internal parameters of a flexible fragment (usually, a loop) of a protein in order to connect its termini to the rest of the protein without causing any steric clash. One must often sample many such conformations in order to explore and adequately represent the conformational range of the studied loop. While sampling must be fast, it is made difficult by the fact that two conflicting constraints - kinematic closure and clash avoidance - must be satisfied concurrently. This paper describes two efficient and complementary sampling algorithms to explore the space of closed clash-free conformations of a flexible protein loop. The "seed sampling" algorithm samples broadly from this space, while the "deformation sampling" algorithm uses seed conformations as starting points to explore the conformation space around them at a finer grain. Computational results are presented for various loops ranging from 5 to 25 residues. More specific results also show that the combination of the sampling algorithms with a functional site prediction software (FEATURE) makes it possible to compute and recognize calcium-binding loop conformations. The sampling algorithms are implemented in a toolkit (LoopTK), which is available at https://simtk.org/home/looptk.

    :abstractText: The real-time simulation of rope, and knot tying in particular, raises difficult issues in contact detection and management. Some practical knots can only be achieved by complicated crossings of the rope, yielding multiple simultaneous contacts, especially when the rope is pulled tight. This paper describes a graphical simulator that allows a user to grasp and smoothly manipulate a virtual rope and to tie arbitrary knots, including knots around other objects, in real time. A first component of the simulator computes the global configuration of the rope based on user interactions. Another component of the simulator precisely detects self-collisions in the rope as well as collisions with other objects. Finally, a third component manages collisions to prevent penetration, while making the rope slide with some friction along itself and other objects, so that knots can be pulled tight in a realistic manner. An additional module uses recent results from knot theory to identify, also in real time, which topological knots have been tied. This work was motivated by surgical suturing, but simulation in other domains, such as sailing and rock climbing, could also benefit from it.

    :abstractText: We report our first experiences with Leaving Flatland, an exploratory project that studies the key challenges of closing the loop between autonomous perception and action on challenging terrain. We propose a comprehensive system for localization, mapping, and planning for the RHex mobile robot in fully 3D indoor and outdoor environments. This system integrates Visual Odometry-based localization with new techniques in real-time 3D mapping from stereo data. The motion planner uses a new decomposition approach to adapt existing 2D planning techniques to operate in 3D terrain. We test the map-building and motion-planning subsystems on real and synthetic data, and show that they have favorable computational performance for use in high-speed autonomous navigation.

However, security in WMN has not received enough attention in the research community. One main challenge in designing WMNs is the vulnerability of such networks to malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose a zone-based distributed key management scheme for WMNs in which we show that the proposed scheme would improve key management in security, expandability, validity, fault tolerance and usability.

    :abstractText: Motion planning problems encountered in manipulation and legged locomotion have a distinctive multi-modal structure, where the space of feasible configurations consists of intersecting submanifolds, often of different dimensionalities. Such a feasible space does not possess expansiveness, a property that characterizes whether planning queries can be solved efficiently with traditional probabilistic roadmap (PRM) planners. In this paper we present a new PRM-based multi-modal planning algorithm for problems where the number of intersecting manifolds is finite. We also analyze the completeness properties of this algorithm. More specifically, we show that the algorithm converges quickly when each submanifold is individually expansive and establish a bound on the expected running time in that case. We also present an incremental variant of the algorithm that has the same convergence properties, but works better for problems with a large number of submanifolds by considering subsets of submanifolds likely to contain a solution path. These algorithms are demonstrated in geometric examples and in a legged locomotion planner.

    :abstractText: "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a well-established method for studying protein motion at the atomic scale. However, it is computationally intensive and generates massive amounts of data. One way of addressing the dual challenges of computation efficiency and data analysis is to construct simplified models of long-timescale protein motion from MD simulation data. In this direction, we propose to use Markov models with hidden states, in which the Markovian states represent potentially overlapping probabilistic distributions over protein conformations. We also propose a principled criterion for evaluating the quality of a model by its ability to predict long-timescale protein motions. Our method was tested on 2D synthetic energy landscapes and two extensively studied peptides, alanine dipeptide and the villin headpiece subdomain (HP-35 NleNle). One interesting finding is that although a widely accepted model of alanine dipeptide contains six states, a simpler model with only three states is equally good for predicting long-timescale motions. We also used the constructed Markov models to estimate important kinetic and dynamic quantities for protein folding, in particular, mean first-passage time. The results are consistent with available experimental measurements. Contact: chiangts@comp.nus.edu.sg"

The proposed system includes comprehensive localization, mapping, path planning, and visualization techniques for a mobile robot to operate autonomously in complex three-dimensional (3D) indoor and outdoor environments.

    :abstractText: We propose a demonstration of extremely scalable modular robotics algorithms developed as part of the Claytronics Project (http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~claytronics/), as well as a demonstration of proof-of-concept prototypes. Our effort envisions multi-million-module robot ensembles able to morph into three-dimensional scenes, eventually with sufficient fidelity so as to convince a human observer the scenes are real. Although this work is potentially revolutionary in the sense that it holds out the possibility of radically altering the relationship between computation, humans, and the physical world, many of the research questions involved are similar in flavor to more mainstream systems research, albeit larger in scale. For instance, as in sensor networks, each robot will incorporate sensing, computation, and communications components. However, unlike most sensor networks each robot will also include mechanisms for actuation and motion. Many of the key challenges in this project involve coordination and communication of sensing and actuation across such large ensembles of independent units.

    :abstractText: The authors envision a world in which computers are provided for public use in locations ranging from coffee shops to medical office waiting rooms. In such a world, only when a user starts to use a computer will it acquire his unique customization and state, which will likewise disappear when he stops using it. For this to be a compelling vision from a user's viewpoint, the customization and state acquisition process must be accurate and nearly instantaneous. For it to be a viable business model, the management and system administration costs of pervasive deployments of machines must be low. To address these challenges, the authors have developedInternet Suspend/Resume, a pervasive computing technology that rapidly personalizes and depersonalizes anonymous hardware for transient use.

It reports on experiences with three versions of ISR and describes work in progress toward the OpenISR version.

    :abstractText: Preserving one's uniquely customized computing environment as one moves to different locations is an enduring challenge in mobile computing. We examine why this capability is valued so highly, and what makes it so difficult to achieve for personal computing applications. We describe a new mechanism called Internet Suspend/Resume (ISR) that overcomes many of the limitations of previous approaches to realizing this capability. ISR enables a hands-free approach to mobile computing that appears well suited to future pervasive computing environments in which commodity hardware may be widely deployed for transient use. We show that ISR can be implemented by layering virtual machine technology on distributed file system technology. We also report on measurements from a prototype that confirm that ISR is already usable today for some common usage scenarios.

    :abstractText: A critical problem in implementing interactive perception applications is the considerable computational cost of current computer vision and machine learning algorithms, which typically run one to two orders of magnitude too slowly to be used interactively. Fortunately, many of these algorithms exhibit coarse-grained task and data parallelism that can be exploited across machines. The SLIPstream project focuses on building a highly-parallel runtime system called Sprout that can harness the computing power of a cluster to execute perception applications with low latency. This paper makes the case for using clusters for perception applications, describes the architecture of the Sprout runtime, and presents two compute-intensive yet interactive applications.

    :abstractText: Safe state abstraction in reinforcement learning allows an agent to ignore aspects of its current state that are irrelevant to its current decision, and therefore speeds up dynamic programming and learning. Like Dietterich''s MAXQ framework, this paper develops methods for safe state abstraction in the context of hierarchical reinforcement learning, in which a hierarchical partial program is used to constrain the policies that are considered. We extend techniques from MAXQ to the context of programmable hierarchical abstract machines (PHAMs), which express complex parameterized behaviors using a simple extension of the Lisp language. We show that our methods preserve the property of hierarchical optimality, i.e., optimality among all policies consistent with the PHAM program. We also show how our methods allow safe detachment, encapsulation, and transfer of learned "subroutine" behaviors, and demonstrate our methods on Dietterich''s taxi domain.

    :abstractText: "We give a declarative formulation of the biases used in inductive concept learning, particularly the Version-Space approach. We then show how the process of learning a concept from examples can be implemented as a first-order deduction from the bias and the facts describing the instances. This has the following advantages: 1) multiple sources and forms of knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process; 2) the learning system can be more fully integrated with the rest of the belie\xC3\xADs and reasoning of a complete intelligent agent. Without a semantics for the bias, we cannot generally and practically build machines that generate inductive biases automatically and hence are able to learn independently. With this in mind, we show how one part of the bias for Meta-DENDRAL, its instance description language, can be represented using first-order axioms called determinations, and can be derived from basic background knowledge about chemistry. The second part of the paper shows how bias can be represented as defaults, allowing shift of bias to be accommodated in a nonmonotonic framework."

    :abstractText: The field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is concerned with inducing logic programs from examples in the presence of background knowledge. This paper defines the ILP problem, and describes the various syntactic restrictions that are commonly used for learning first-order representations. We then derive some positive results concerning the learnability of these restricted classes of logic programs, by reduction to a standard propositional learning problem. More specifically, k-clause predicate definitions consisting of determinate, function-free, non-recursve Horn clauses with variables of bounded depth are polynomially learnable under simple distributions. Similarly, recursive k-clause definitions are polynomially learnable under simple distributions if we allow existential and membership queries about the target concept.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces and illustrates BLOG, a formal language for defining probability models over worlds with unknown objects and identity uncertainty. BLOG unifies and extends several existing approaches. Subject to certain acyclicity constraints, every BLOG model specifies a unique probability distribution over first-order model structures that can contain varying and unbounded numbers of objects. Furthermore, complete inference algorithms exist for a large fragment of the language. We also introduce a probabilistic form of Skolemization for handling evidence.

    :abstractText: Filtering denotes any method whereby an agent updates its belief state--its knowledge of the state of the world--from a sequence of actions and observations. In logical filtering, the belief state is a logical formula describing possible world states and the agent has a (possibly nondeterministic) logical model of its environment and sensors. This paper presents efficient logical filtering algorithms that maintain a compact belief state representation indefinitely, for a broad range of environment classes including nondeterministic, partially observable STRIPS environments and environments in which actions permute the state space. Efficient filtering is also possible when the belief state is represented using prime implicates, or when it is approximated by a logically weaker formula.

    :abstractText: Dynamic probabilistic networks (DPNs) are a useful tool for modeling complex stochastic processes. The simplest inference task in DPNs is monitoring- that is, computing a posterior distribution for the state variables at each time step given all observations up to that time. Recursive, constant-space algorithms are well-known for monitoring in DPNs and other models. This paper is concerned with hindsight -that is, computing a posterior distribution given both past and future observations. Hindsight is an essential subtask of learning DPN models from data. Existing algorithms for hindsight in DPNs use O(SN) space and time, where N is the total length of the observation sequence and S is the state space size for each time step. They are therefore impractical for hindsight in complex models with long observation sequences. This paper presents an O(S log N) space, O(SN log N) time hindsight algorithm. We demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in two real-world DPN learning problems. We also discuss the possibility of an O(S)-space, O(SiV)-time algorithm.

    :abstractText: "We analyze the logical form of the domain knowledge that grounds analogical inferences and generalizations from a single instance. The form of the assumptions which justify analogies is given schematically as the \"determination rule\", so called because it expresses the relation of one set of variables determining the values of another set. The determination relation is a logical generalization of the different types of dependency relations denned in database theory. Specifically, we define determination as a relation between schemata of first order logic that have two kinds of free variables: (1) object variables and (2) what we call \"polar\" variables, which hold the place of truth values. Determination rules facilitate sound rule inference and valid conclusions projected by analogy from single instances, without implying what the conclusion should be prior to an inspection of the instance. They also provide a way to specify what information is sufficiently relevant to decide a question, prior to knowledge of the answer to the question."

    :abstractText: The problem of driving an autonomous vehicle in normal traffic engages many areas of AI research and has substantial economic significance. We describe work in progress on a new approach to this problem that uses a decision-theoretic architecture using dynamic probabilistic networks. The architecture provides a sound solution to the problems of sensor noise, sensor failure, and uncertainty about the behavior of other vehicles and about the effects of one's own actions. We report on advances in the theory of inference and decision making in dynamic, partially observable domains. Our approach has been implemented in a simulation system, and the autonomous vehicle successfully negotiates a variety of difficult situations.

    :abstractText: "In recent years, there has been much interest in learning Bayesian networks from data. Learning such models is desirable simply because there is a wide array of off-the-shelf tools that can apply the learned models as expert systems, diagnosis engines, and decision support systems. Practitioners also claim that adaptive Bayesian networks have advantages in their own right as a non-parametric method for density estimation, data analysis, pattern classification, and modeling. Among the reasons cited we find: their semantic clarity and understandability by humans, the ease of acquisition and incorporation of prior knowledge, the ease of integration with optimal decision-making methods, the possibility of causal interpretation of learned models, and the automatic handling of noisy and missing data. In spite of these claims, and the initial success reported recently, methods that learn Bayesian networks have yet to make the impact that other techniques such as neural networks and hidden Markov models have made in applications such as pattern and speech recognition. In this paper, we challenge the research community to identify and characterize domains where induction of Bayesian networks makes the critical difference, and to quantify the factors that are responsible for that difference. In addition to formalizing the challenge, we identify research problems whose solution is, in our view, crucial for meeting this challenge."

    :abstractText: Object identification--the task of deciding that two observed objects are in fact one and the same object--is a fundamental requirement for any situated agent that reasons about individuals. Object identity, as represented by the equality operator between two terms in predicate calculus, is essentially a first-order concept. Raw sensory observations, on the other hand, are essentially propositional-- especially when formulated as evidence in standard probability theory. This paper describes patterns of reasoning that allow identity sentences to be grounded in sensory observations, thereby bridging the gap. We begin by defining a physical event space over which probabilities are defined. We then introduce an identity criterion, which selects those events that correspond to identity between observed objects. From this, we are able to compute the probability that any two objects are the same, given a stream of observations of many objects. We show that the appearance probability, which defines how an object can be expected to appear at subsequent observations given its current appearance, is a natural model for this type of reasoning. We apply the theory to the task of recognizing cars observed by cameras at widely separated sites in a freeway network, with new heuristics to handle the inevitable complexity of matching large numbers of objects and with online learning of appearance probability models. Despite extremely noisy observations, we are able to achieve high levels of performance.

    :abstractText: We consider applying hierarchical reinforcement learning techniques to problems in which an agent has several effectors to control simultaneously. We argue that the kind of prior knowledge one typically has about such problems is best expressed using a multithreaded partial program, and present concurrent ALisp, a language for specifying such partial programs. We describe algorithms for learning and acting with concurrent ALisp that can be efficient even when there are exponentially many joint choices at each decision point. Finally, we show results of applying these methods to a complex computer game domain.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces and illustrates BLOG, a formal language for defining probability models over worlds with unknown objects and identity uncertainty. BLOG unifies and extends several existing approaches. Subject to certain acyclicity constraints, every BLOG model specifies a unique probability distribution over first-order model structures that can contain varying and unbounded numbers of objects. Furthermore, complete inference algorithms exist for a large fragment of the language. We also introduce a probabilistic form of Skolemization for handling evidence.

    :abstractText: A key open problem in reinforcement learning is to assure convergence when using a compact hypothesis class to approximate the value function. Although the standard temporal-difference learning algorithm has been shown to converge when the hypothesis class is a linear combination of fixed basis functions, it may diverge with a general (non-linear) hypothesis class. This paper describes the Bridge algorithm, a new method for reinforcement learning, and shows that it converges to an approximate global optimum for any agnostically learnable hypothesis class. Convergence is demonstrated on a simple example for which temporal-difference learning fails. Weak conditions are identified under which the Bridge algorithm converges for any hypothesis class. Finally, connections are made between the complexity of reinforcement learning and the PAC-learnability of the hypothesis class.

    :abstractText: The problem of making optimal decisions in uncertain conditions is central to Artificial Intelligence If the state of the world is known at all times, the world can be modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) MDPs have been studied extensively and many methods are known for determining optimal courses of action or policies. The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning meth ods a combination that was very effective in our test cases.

    :abstractText: A new, general approach is described for approximate inference in first-order probabilistic languages, using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in the space of concrete possible worlds underlying any given knowledge base. The simplicity of the approach and its lazy construction of possible worlds make it possible to consider quite expressive languages. In particular, we consider two extensions to the basic relational probability models (RPMs) defined by Koller and Pfeffer, both of which have caused difficulties for exact algorithms. The first extension deals with uncertainty about relations among objects, where MCMC samples over relational structures. The second extension deals with uncertainty about the identity of individuals, where MCMC samples over sets of equivalence classes of objects. In both cases, we identify types of probability distributions that allow local decomposition of inference while encoding possible domains in a plausible way. We apply our algorithms to simple examples and show that the MCMC approach scales well.

    :abstractText: Keeping track of multiple objects over time is a problem that arises in many real-world domains. The problem is often complicated by noisy sensors and unpredictable dynamics. Previous work by Huang and Russell, drawing on the data association literature, provided a probabilistic analysis and a threshold-based approximation algorithm for the case of multiple objects detected by two spatially separated sensors. This paper analyses the case in which large numbers of sensors are involved. We show that the approach taken by Huang and Russell, who used pairwise sensor-based appearance probabilities as the elementary probabilistic model, does not scale. When more than two observations are made, the objects' intrinsic properties must be estimated. These provide the necessary conditional independencies to allow a spatial decomposition of the global probability model. We also replace Huang and Russell's threshold algorithm for object identification with a polynomial-time approximation scheme based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Using sensor data from a freeway traffic simulation, we show that this allows accurate estimation of long-range origin/destination information even when the individual links in the sensor chain are highly unreliable.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces a partition of the possible forms of knowledge according to their relationship to the basic objective of an intelligent agent, namely to act successfully in response to its environment. The resulting classes of knowledge range from fully declarative to fully compiled. From these classes, it is possible to generate 1) a set of execution architectures, each of which combines some of the classes to produce decisions; and 2) a set of compilation methods, that transform knowledge into more efficient but (approximately) behaviourally equivalent, compiled forms. Existing compilation methods can be understood within this framework, and new compilation methods and execution architectures are indicated. It is proposed that systems with the ability to learn, use and transform between all the types of knowledge may be able to achieve simultaneously higher levels of competence, efficiency and flexibility.

Productive research in AI, both practical and theoretical, benefits from a notion of intelligence that is precise enough to allow the cumulative development of robust systems and general results. This paper outlines a gradual evolution in our formal conception of intelligence that brings it closer to our informal conception and simultaneously reduces the gap between theory and practice.

    :abstractText: Probabilistic networks which provide compact descriptions of complex stochastic relationships among several random variables are rapidly becoming the tool of choice for uncertain reasoning in artificial intelligence. We show that networks with fixed structure containing hidden variables can be learned automatically from data using a gradient-descent mechanism similar to that used in neural networks We also extend the method to networks with intensionally represented distributions, including networks with continuous variables and dynamic probabilistic networks Because probabilistic networks provide explicit representations of causal structure human experts can easily contribute pnor knowledge to the training process, thereby significantly improving the learning rate Adaptive probabilistic networks (APNs) may soon compete directly with neural networks as models in computational neuroscience as well as in industrial and financial applications.

    :abstractText: A program is bounded optimal for a given computational device for a given environment, if the expected utility of the program running on the device in the environment is at least as high as that of all other programs for the device. Bounded optimality differs from the decision-theoretic notion of rationality in that it explicitly allows for the finite computational resources of real agents. It is thus a central issue in the foundations of artificial intelligence. In this paper we consider a restricted class of agent architectures, in which a program consists of a sequence of decision procedures generated by a learning program or given a prion. For this class of agents, we give an efficient construction algorithm that generates a bounded optimal program for any episodic environment, given a set of training examples. The algorithm includes solutions to a new class of optimization problems, namely scheduling computational processes for real-time environments. This class appears to contain significant practical applications.

    :abstractText: The paper reports on new algorithms for solving partially observable games. Whereas existing algorithms apply AND-OR search to a tree of blackbox belief states, our "incremental" versions treat uncertainty as a new search dimension, examining the physical states within a belief state to construct solution trees incrementally. On a newly created database of checkmate problems for Kriegspiel (a partially observable form of chess), incrementalization yields speedups of two or more orders of magnitude on hard instances.

    :abstractText: In this paper we outline a general approach to the study of problem-solving, in which search steps are considered decisions in the same sense as actions in the world. Unlike other metrics in the literature, the value of a search step is defined as a real utility rather than as a quasi-utility, and can therefore be computed directly from a model of the base-level problem-solver. We develop a formula for the expected value of a search step in a game-playing context using the single-step assumption, namely that a computation step can be evaluated as it was the last to be taken. We prove some meta-level theorems that enable the development of a low-overhead algorithm, MGSS*, that chooses search steps in order of highest estimated utility. Although we show that the single-step assumption is untenable in general, a program implemented for the game of Othello soundly beats an alpha-beta search while expanding significantly fewer nodes, even though both programs use the same evaluation function.

    :abstractText: We present a method to construct real-time systems using as components anytime algorithms whose quality of results degrades gracefully as computation time decreases. Introducing computation time as a degree of freedom defines a scheduling problem involving the activation and interruption of the anytime components. This scheduling problem is especially complicated when trying to construct interruptible algorithms, whose total run-time is unknown in advance. We introduce a framework to measure the performance of anytime algorithms and solve the problem of constructing interruptible algorithms by a mathematical reduction to the problem of constructing contract algorithms, which require the determination of the total run-time when activated. We show how the composition of anytime algorithms can be mechanized as part of a compiler for a LISP-like programming language for real-time systems. The result is a new approach to the construction of complex real-time systems that separates the arrangement of the performance components from the optimization of their scheduling, and automates the latter task.

    :abstractText: This paper surveys first-order probabilistic languages (FOPLs), which combine the expressive power of first-order logic with a probabilistic treatment of uncertainty. We provide a taxonomy that helps make sense of the profusion of FOPLs that have been proposed over the past fifteen years. We also emphasize the importance of representing uncertainty not just about the attributes and relations of a fixed set of objects, but also about what objects exist. This leads us to Bayesian logic, or BLOG, a language for defining probabilistic models with unknown objects. We give a brief overview of BLOG syntax and semantics, and emphasize some of the design decisions that distinguish it from other languages. Finally, we consider the challenge of constructing FOPL models automatically from data.

    :abstractText: Bagging and boosting are well-known ensemble learning methods. They combine multiple learned base models with the aim of improving generalization performance. To date, they have been used primarily in batch mode, i.e., they require multiple passes through the training data. In previous work, we presented online bagging and boosting algorithms that only require one pass through the training data and presented experimental results on some relatively small datasets. Through additional experiments on a variety of larger synthetic and real datasets, this paper demonstrates that our online versions perform comparably to their batch counterparts in terms of classification accuracy. We also demonstrate the substantial reduction in running time we obtain with our online algorithms because they require fewer passes through the training data.

    :abstractText: Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centred around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.

    :abstractText: Probabilistic networks (also known as Bayesian belief networks) allow a compact description of complex stochastic relationships among several random variables. They are used widely for uncertain reasoning in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we investigate the problem of learning probabilistic networks with known structure and hidden variables. This is an important problem, because structure is much easier to elicit from experts than numbers, and the world is rarely fully observable. We present a gradient-based algorithm and show that the gradient can be computed locally, using information that is available as a byproduct of standard inference algorithms for probabilistic networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that using prior knowledge about the structure, even with hidden variables, can significantly improve the learning rate of probabilistic networks. We extend the method to networks in which the conditional probability tables are described using a small number of parameters. Examples include noisy-OR nodes and dynamic probabilistic networks. We show how this additional structure can be exploited by our algorithm to speed up the learning even further. We also outline an extension to hybrid networks, in which some of the nodes take on values in a continuous domain.

    :abstractText: It is well known that prior knowledge or bias can speed up learning, at least in theory. It has proved difficult to make constructive use of prior knowledge, so that approximately correct hypotheses can be learned efficiently. In this paper, we consider a particular form of bias which consists of a set of &ldquo;determinations.&rdquo; A set of attributes is said to determine a given attribute if the latter is purely a function of the former. The bias is tree-structured if there is a tree of attributes such that the attribute at any node is determined by its children, where the leaves correspond to input attributes and the root corresponds to the target attribute for the learning problem. The set of allowed functions at each node is called the basis. The tree-structured bias restricts the target functions to those representable by a read-once formula (a Boolean formula in which each variable occurs at most once) of a given structure over the basis functions. We show that efficient learning is possible using a given tree-structured bias from random examples and membership queries, provided that the basis class itself is learnable and obeys some mild closure conditions. The algorithm uses a form of controlled experimentation in order to learn each part of the overall function, fixing the inputs to the other parts of the function at appropriate values. We present empirical results showing that when a tree-structured bias is available, our method significantly improves upon knowledge-free induction. We also show that there are hard cryptographic limitations to generalizing these positive results to structured determinations in the form of a directed acyclic graph.

    :abstractText: "This paper is specifically concerned with the topic of limited rationality--- the generation of utility-maximizing behaviour in a non-static environment by a system with finite computational resources. The design of the RALPH (Rational Agent with Limited Performance Hardware) architecture aims to tie together, in a unified theoretical framework and a single system design, three strands of research relevant to this problem: the study of metareasoning procedures, that is, decision procedures that select computations to direct the course of another decision procedure; the compilation of decision processes that explicitly maximize utility into efficiently-executable policies and goals, and their integration into the decision procedure; and the generation of planning behaviour, directed towards an explicitly-represented goal, in the context of decision theory. Decision procedures are implemented by four distinct execution architectures, running in parallel, each characterized by the types of knowledge employed. Only fragments of the architecture are currently implemented, but some progress has been made on the individual topics."

    :abstractText: We present an algorithm for coordinated decision making in cooperative multiagent settings, where the agents' value function canbe represented as a sum of context-specific <i>value rules</i>. The task of finding an optimal joint action in this setting leads to an algorithm where the coordination structure between agents depends on the current state of the system and even on the actual mmaerical values assigned to the value rules. We apply this framework to the task of multiagent planning in dynamic systems, showing how a joint value function of the associated Markov Decision Process can be approximated as a set of value rules using an efficient linear programming algorithm. The agents then apply the coordination graph algorithm at each iteration of the process to decide on the highest-value joint action, potentially leading to a different coordination pattern at each step of the plan.

    :abstractText: The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on an exact factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.

    :abstractText: Consider the problem of a group of agents trying to find a stable strategy profile for a joint interaction. A standard approach is to describe the situation as a single multiplayer game and find an equilibrium strategy profile of that game. However, most algorithms for finding equilibria are computationally expensive; they are also centralized, requiring that all relevant payoff information be available to a single agent (or computer) who must determine the entire equilibrium profile. In this paper, we exploit two ideas to address these problems. We consider structured game representations, where the interaction between the agents is sparse, an assumption that holds in many real-world situations. We also consider the slightly relaxed task of finding an approximate equilibrium. We present two algorithms for finding approximate equilibria in these games, one based on a hill-climbing approach and one on constraint satisfaction. We show that these algorithms exploit the game structure to achieve faster computation. They are also inherently local, requiring only limited communication between directly interacting agents. They can thus be scaled to games involving large numbers of agents, provided the interaction between the agents is not too dense.

    :abstractText: "Game-theoretic characterisations of complexity classes have often proved useful in understanding the power and limitations of these classes. One well-known example tells us that PSPACE can be characterized by two-person, perfect-information games in which the length of a played game is polynomial in the length of the description of the initial position [by Chandra et al., see Journal of the ACM, vol. 28, p. 114-33 (1981)]. In this paper, we investigate the connection between game theory and interactive computation. We formalize the notion of a polynomially definable game system for the language L, which, informally, consists of two arbitrarily powerful players P/sub 1/ and P/sub 2/ and a polynomial-time referee V with a common input w. Player P/sub 1/ claims that w/spl isin/L, and player P/sub 2/ claims that w/spl isin/L; the referee's job is to decide which of these two claims is true. In general, we wish to study the following question: What is the effect of varying the system's game-theoretic properties on the class of languages recognizable by polynomially definable game systems? There are many possible game-theoretic properties that we could investigate in this context. The focus of this paper is the question of what happens when one or both of the players P/sub 1/ and P/sub 2/ have imperfect information or imperfect recall. We use polynomially definable game systems to derive new characterizations of the complexity classes NEXP and coNEXP."

    :abstractText: We address the problem of segmenting 3D scan data into objects or object classes. Our segmentation framework is based on a subclass of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) which support efficient graph-cut inference. The MRF models incorporate a large set of diverse features and enforce the preference that adjacent scan points have the same classification label. We use a recently proposed maximum-margin framework to discriminatively train the model from a set of labeled scans; as a result we automatically learn the relative importance of the features for the segmentation task. Performing graph-cut inference in the trained MRF can then be used to segment new scenes very efficiently. We test our approach on three large-scale datasets produced by different kinds of 3D sensors, showing its applicability to both outdoor and indoor environments containing diverse objects.

    :abstractText: We consider the important challenge of recognizing a variety of deformable object classes in images. Of fundamental importance and particular difficulty in this setting is the problem of "outlining" an object, rather than simply deciding on its presence or absence. A major obstacle in learning a model that will allow us to address this task is the need for hand-segmented training images. In this paper we present a novel landmark-based, piecewise-linear model of the shape of an object class. We then formulate a learning approach that allows us to learn this model with minimal user supervision. We circumvent the need for hand-segmentation by transferring the shape "essence" of an object from drawings to complex images. We show that our method is able to automatically and effectively learn and localize a variety of object classes.

    :abstractText: We address the problem of detecting complex articulated objects and their pose in 3D range scan data. This task is very difficult when the orientation of the object is unknown, and occlusion and clutter are present in the scene. To address the problem, we design an efficient probabilistic framework, based on the articulated model of an object, which combines multiple information sources. Our framework enforces that the surfaces and edge discontinuities of model parts are matched well in the scene while respecting the rules of occlusion, that joint constraints and angles are maintained, and that object parts don't intersect. Our approach starts by using low-level detectors to suggest part placement hypotheses. In a hypothesis enrichment phase, these original hypotheses are used to generate likely placement suggestions for their neighboring parts. The probabilities over the possible part placement configurations are computed using efficient OpenGL rendering. Loopy belief propagation is used to optimize the resulting Markov network to obtain the most likely object configuration, which is additionally refined using an Iterative Closest Point algorithm adapted for articulated models. Our model is tested on several datasets, where we demonstrate successful pose detection for models consisting of 15 parts or more, even when the object is seen from different viewpoints, and various occluding objects and clutter are present in the scene.

    :abstractText: The sliding window approach of detecting rigid objects (such as cars) is predicated on the belief that the object can be identified from the appearance in a small region around the object. Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages "context" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors.

An algorithm called the hidden paths algorithm, which finds these paths in time O(m*+n n/sup 2/ log n), where m* is the number of edges participating in shortest paths, is presented. It is argued that m* is likely to be small in practice, since m*=O(n log n) with high probability for many probability distributions on edge weights. An Omega (mn) lower bound on the running time of any path-comparison-based algorithm for the all-pairs shortest paths problem is proved.

    :abstractText: Proposes a new approach for vision-based longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. The novel feature of this approach is the use of binocular vision. We integrate two modules consisting of a new, domain-specific, efficient binocular stereo algorithm, and a lane marker detection algorithm, and show that the integration results in a improved performance for each of the modules. Longitudinal control is supported by detecting and measuring the distances to leading vehicles using binocular stereo. The knowledge of the camera geometry with respect to the locally planar road is used to map the images of the road plane in the two camera views into alignment. This allows us to separate image features into those lying in the road plane, e.g. lane markers, and those due to other objects which are dynamically integrated into an obstacle map. Therefore, in contrast with the previous work, we can cope with the difficulties arising from occlusion of lane markers by other vehicles. The detection and measurement of the lane markers provides us with the positional parameters and the road curvature which are needed for lateral vehicle control. Moreover, this information is also used to update the camera geometry with respect to the road, therefore allowing us to cope with the problem of vibrations and road inclination to obtain consistent results from binocular stereo.

    :abstractText: Many applications of supervised learning require good generalization from limited labeled data. In the Bayesian setting, we can try to achieve this goal by using an informative prior over the parameters, one that encodes useful domain knowledge. Focusing on logistic regression, we present an algorithm for automatically constructing a multivariate Gaussian prior with a full covariance matrix for a given supervised learning task. This prior relaxes a commonly used but overly simplistic independence assumption, and allows parameters to be dependent. The algorithm uses other "similar" learning problems to estimate the covariance of pairs of individual parameters. We then use a semidefinite program to combine these estimates and learn a good prior for the current learning task. We apply our methods to binary text classification, and demonstrate a 20 to 40% test error reduction over a commonly used prior.

    :abstractText: Markov networks are extensively used to model complex sequential, spatial, and relational interactions in fields as diverse as image processing, natural language analysis, and bioinformatics. However, inference and learning in general Markov networks is intractable. In this paper, we focus on learning a large subclass of such models (called associative Markov networks) that are tractable or closely approximable. This subclass contains networks of discrete variables with K labels each and clique potentials that favor the same labels for all variables in the clique. Such networks capture the "guilt by association" pattern of reasoning present in many domains, in which connected ("associated") variables tend to have the same label. Our approach exploits a linear programming relaxation for the task of finding the best joint assignment in such networks, which provides an approximate quadratic program (QP) for the problem of learning a margin-maximizing Markov network. We show that for associative Markov network over binary-valued variables, this approximate QP is guaranteed to return an optimal parameterization for Markov networks of arbitrary topology. For the nonbinary case, optimality is not guaranteed, but the relaxation produces good solutions in practice. Experimental results with hypertext and newswire classification show significant advantages over standard approaches.

    :abstractText: We consider large margin estimation in a broad range of prediction models where inference involves solving combinatorial optimization problems, for example, weighted graph-cuts or matchings. Our goal is to learn parameters such that inference using the model reproduces correct answers on the training data. Our method relies on the expressive power of convex optimization problems to compactly capture inference or solution optimality in structured prediction models. Directly embedding this structure within the learning formulation produces concise convex problems for efficient estimation of very complex and diverse models. We describe experimental results on a matching task, disulfide connectivity prediction, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

    :abstractText: "In many prediction tasks, selecting relevant features is essential for achieving good generalization performance. Most feature selection algorithms consider all features to be a priori equally likely to be relevant. In this paper, we use transfer learning---learning on an ensemble of related tasks---to construct an informative prior on feature relevance. We assume that features themselves have meta-features that are predictive of their relevance to the prediction task, and model their relevance as a function of the meta-features using hyperparameters (called meta-priors). We present a convex optimization algorithm for simultaneously learning the meta-priors and feature weights from an ensemble of related prediction tasks which share a similar relevance structure. Our approach transfers the \"meta-priors\" among different tasks, which makes it possible to deal with settings where tasks have nonoverlapping features or the relevance of the features vary over the tasks. We show that learning feature relevance improves performance on two real data sets which illustrate such settings: (1) predicting ratings in a collaborative filtering task, and (2) distinguishing arguments of a verb in a sentence."

    :abstractText: "We describe a new approach to default, reasoning, based on a principle on indifference among possible worlds. We interpret default rules as extreme statistical statements, thus obtaining a knowledge base KB comprised of statistical and first-order statements. We then assign equal probability to all worlds consistent with KB in order to assign a degree of belief to a statement \xCE\xA6. The degree of belief can be used to decide whether to defeasibly conclude \xCE\xA6. Various natural patterns of reasoning, such as a preference for more specific defaults, indifference to irrelevant information, and the ability to combine independent pieces of evidence, turn out to follow naturally from this technique. Furthermore, our approach is not restricted to default reasoning; it supports a spectrum of reasoning, from quantitative to qualitative. It is also related to other systems for default reasoning. In particular, we show that the work of [Goldszmidt et al., 1990], which applies maximum entropy ideas to --semantics, can be embedded in our framework."

    :abstractText: Structured game representations have recently attracted interest as models for multi-agent artificial intelligence scenarios, with rational behavior most commonly characterized by Nash equilibria. This paper presents efficient, exact algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in structured game representations, including both graphical games and multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs). The algorithms are derived from a continuation method for normal-form and extensive-form games due to Govindan and Wilson; they follow a trajectory through a space of perturbed games and their equilibria, exploiting game structure through fast computation of the Jacobian of the payoff function. They are theoretically guaranteed to find at least one equilibrium of the game, and may find more. Our approach provides the first efficient algorithm for computing exact equilibria in graphical games with arbitrary topology, and the first algorithm to exploit fine-grained structural properties of MAIDs. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms and comparing them to predecessors. The running time of the graphical game algorithm is similar to, and often better than, the running time of previous approximate algorithms. The algorithm for MAIDs can effectively solve games that are much larger than those solvable by previous methods.

    :abstractText: A large portion of real-world data is stored in commercial relational database systems. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work only with "flat" data representations. Thus, to apply these methods, we are forced to convert our data into a flat form, thereby losing much of the relational structure present in our database. This paper builds on the recent work on probabilistic relational models (PRMs), and describes how to learn them from databases. PRMs allow the properties of an object to depend probabilistically both on other properties of that object and on properties of related objects. Although PRMs are significantly more expressive than standard models, such as Bayesian networks, we show how to extend well-known statistical methods for learning Bayesian networks to learn these models. We describe both parameter estimation and structure learning -- the automatic induction of the dependency structure in a model. Moreover, we show how the learning procedure can exploit standard database retrieval techniques for efficient learning from large datasets. We present experimental results on both real and synthetic relational databases.

    :abstractText: "Non-deductive reasoning systems are often representation dependent: representing the same situation in two different ways may cause such a system to return two different answers. Some have viewed this as a significant problem. For example, the principle of maximum entropy has been subjected to much criticism due to its representation dependence. There has, however, been almost no work investigating representation dependence. In this paper, we formalize this notion and show that it is not a problem specific to maximum entropy. In fact, we show that any representation-independent probabilistic inference procedure that ignores irrelevant information is essentially entailment, in a precise sense. Moreover, we show that representation independence is incompatible with even a weak default assumption of independence. We then show that invariance under a restricted class of representation changes can form a reasonable compromise between representation independence and other desiderata, and provide a construction of a family of inference procedures that provides such restricted representation independence, using relative entropy."

    :abstractText: A longstanding goal in planning research is the ability to generalize plans developed for some set of environments to a new but similar environment, with minimal or no replanning. Such generalization can both reduce planning time and allow us to tackle larger domains than the ones tractable for direct planning. In this paper, we present an approach to the generalization problem based on a new framework of relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs). An RMDP can model a set of similar environments by representing objects as instances of different classes. In order to generalize plans to multiple environments, we define an approximate value function specified in terms of classes of objects and, in a multiagent setting, by classes of agents. This class-based approximate value function is optimized relative to a sampled subset of environments, and computed using an efficient linear programming method. We prove that a polynomial number of sampled environments suffices to achieve performance close to the performance achievable when optimizing over the entire space. Our experimental results show that our method generalizes plans successfully to new, significantly larger, environments, with minimal loss of performance relative to environment-specific planning. We demonstrate our approach on a real strategic computer war game.

    :abstractText: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a coherent mathematical framework for planning under uncertainty. However, exact MDP solution algorithms require the manipulation of a value function, which specifies a value for each state in the system. Most real-world MDPs are too large for such a representation to be feasible, preventing the use of exact MDP algorithms. Various approximate solution algorithms have been proposed, many of which use a linear combination of basis functions as a compact approximation to the value function. Almost all of these algorithms use an approximation based on the (weighted) L2-norm (Euclidean distance); this approach prevents the application of standard convergence results for MDP algorithms, all of which are based on max-norm. This paper makes two contributions. First, it presents the first approximate MDP solution algorithms - both value and policy iteration - that use max-norm projection, thereby directly optimizing the quantity required to obtain the best error bounds. Second, it shows how these algorithms can be applied efficiently in the context of factored MDPs, where the transition model is specified using a dynamic Bayesian network.

Our algorithm generalizes the recent E3 algorithm of Kearns and Singh, and assumes that we are given both an algorithm for approximate planning, and the graphical structure (but not the parameters) of the DBN. Unlike the original E3 algorithm, our new algorithm exploits the DBN structure to achieve a running time that scales polynomially in the number of parameters of the DBN, which may be exponentially smaller than the number of global states.

    :abstractText: "The traditional representations of games using the extensive form or the strategic (normal) form obscure much of the structure that is present in real-world games. In this paper, we propose a new representation language for general multiplayer games--multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs). This representation extends graphical models for probability distributions to a multi-agent decision-making context. MAIDs explicitly encode structure involving the dependence relationships among variables. As a consequence, we can define a notion of strategic relevance of one decision variable to another: D\xE2\x80\xB2 is strategically relevant to D if, to optimize the decision rule at D, the decision maker needs to take into consideration the decision rule at D\xE2\x80\xB2. We provide a sound and complete graphical criterion for determining strategic relevance. We then show how strategic relevance can be used to detect structure in games, allowing a large game to be broken up into a set of interacting smaller games, which can be solved in sequence. We show that this decomposition can lead to substantial savings in the computational cost of finding Nash equilibria in these games."

    :abstractText: Work on game playing in AI has typically ignored games of imperfect information such as poker. In this paper we present a framework for dealing with such games. We point out several important issues that arise only in the context of imperfect information games particularly the insufficiency of a simple game tree model to represent the players information state and the need for randomization in the players optimal strategies. We describe Gala an implemented system that provides the user with a very natural and expressive language for describing games. From a game description Gala creates an augmented game tree with information sets which can be used by various algorithms in order to find optimal strategies for that game. In particular Gala implements the first practical algorithm for finding optimal randomized strategies in two player imperfect information competitive games [Koller et al 1994]. The running time of this algorithm is palinomial in the size of the game tree whereas previous algorithms were exponential. We present experimental results showing that this algorithm is also efficient in practice and can therefore form the basis for a game playing system.

    :abstractText: "Many large Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be represented compactly using a structured representation such as a dynamic Bayesian network. Unfortunately, the compact representation does not help standard MDP algorithms, because the value function for the MDP does not retain the structure of the process description. We argue that in many such MDPs, structure is approximately retained. That is, the value functions are nearly additive: closely approximated by a linear function over factors associated with small subsets of problem features. Based on this idea, we present a convergent, approximate value determination algorithm for structured MDPs. The algorithm maintains an additive value function, alternating dynamic programming steps with steps that project the result back into the restricted space of additive functions. We show that both the dynamic programming and the projection steps can be computed efficiently, despite the fact that the number of states is exponential in the number of state variables."

    :abstractText: Supervised and unsupervised learning methods have traditionally focused on data consisting of independent instances of a single type. However, many real-world domains are best described by relational models in which instances of multiple types are related to each other in complex ways. For example, in a scientific paper domain, papers are related to each other via citation, and are also related to their authors. In this case, the label of one entity (e.g., the topic of the paper) is often correlated with the labels of related entities. We propose a general class of models for classification and clustering in relational domains that capture probabilistic dependencies between related instances. We show how to learn such models efficiently from data. We present empirical results on two real world data sets. Our experiments in a transductive classification setting indicate that accuracy can be significantly improved by modeling relational dependencies. Our algorithm automatically induces a very natural behavior, where our knowledge about one instance helps us classify related ones, which in turn help us classify others. In an unsupervised setting, our models produced coherent clusters with a very natural interpretation, even for instance types that do not have any attributes.

    :abstractText: The task of causal structure discovery from empirical data is a fundamental problem in many areas. Experimental data is crucial for accomplishing this task. However, experiments are typically expensive, and must be selected with great care. This paper uses active learning to determine the experiments that are most informative towards uncovering the underlying structure. We formalize the causal learning task as that of learning the structure of a causal Bayesian network. We consider an active learner that is allowed to conduct experiments, where it intervenes in the domain by setting the values of certain variables. We provide a theoretical framework for the active learning problem, and an algorithm that actively chooses the experiments to perform based on the model learned so far. Experimental results show that active learning can substantially reduce the number of observations required to determine the structure of a domain.

    :abstractText: "Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula \xCE\xA6 holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,..., N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which \xCE\xA6 is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying \xCE\xA6 and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods."

    :abstractText: In word sense disambiguation, a system attempts to determine the sense of a word from contextual features. Major barriers to building a high-performing word sense disambiguation system include the difficulty of labeling data for this task and of predicting fine-grained sense distinctions. These issues stem partly from the fact that the task is being treated in isolation from possible uses of automatically disambiguated data. In this paper, we consider the related task of word translation, where we wish to determine the correct translation of a word from context. We can use parallel language corpora as a large supply of partially labeled data for this task. We present algorithms for solving the word translation problem and demonstrate a significant improvement over a baseline system. We then show that the word-translation system can be used to improve performance on a simplified machine-translation task and can effectively and accurately prune the set of candidate translations for a word.

    :abstractText: Discriminative tasks, including object categorization and detection, are central components of high-level computer vision. However, sometimes we are interested in a finer-grained characterization of the object's properties, such as its pose or articulation. In this paper we develop a probabilistic method (LOOPS) that can learn a shape and appearance model for a particular object class, and be used to consistently localize constituent elements (landmarks) of the object's outline in test images. This localization effectively projects the test image into an alternative representational space that makes it particularly easy to perform various descriptive tasks. We apply our method to a range of object classes in cluttered images and demonstrate its effectiveness in localizing objects and performing descriptive classification, descriptive ranking, and descriptive clustering.

    :abstractText: Many of the functions carried out by a living cell are regulated at the transcriptional level, to ensure that genes are expressed when they are needed. Thus, to understand biological processes, it is thus necessary to understand the cell's transcriptional network. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic model of gene regulation for the task of identifying overlapping biological processes and the regulatory mechanism controlling their activation. A key feature of our approach is that we allow genes to participate in multiple processes, thus providing a more biologically plausible model for the process of gene regulation. We present an algorithm to learn this model automatically from data, using only genome-wide measurements of gene expression as input. We compare our results to those obtained by other approaches, and show significant benefits can be gained by modeling both the organization of genes into overlapping cellular processes and the regulatory programs of these processes. Moreover, our method successfully grouped genes known to function together, recovered many regulatory relationships that are known in the literature, and suggested novel hypotheses regarding the regulatory role of previously uncharacterized proteins.

    :abstractText: "We present a probabilistic framework that models the process by which transcriptional binding explains the mRNA expression of different genes. Our joint probabilistic model unifies the two key components of this process: the prediction of gene regulation events from sequence motifs in the gene's promoter region, and the prediction of mRNA expression from combinations of gene regulation events in different settings. Our approach has several advantages. By learning promoter sequence motifs that are directly predictive of expression data, it can improve the identification of binding site patterns. It is also able to identify combinatorial regulation via interactions of different transcription factors. Finally, the general framework allows us to integrate additional data sources, including data from the recent binding localization assays. We demonstrate our approach on the cell cycle data of Spellman et al., combined with the binding localization information of Simon et al. We show that the learned model predicts expression from sequence, and that it identifies coherent co-regulated groups with significant transcription factor motifs. It also provides valuable biological insight into the domain via these co-regulated \"modules\" and the combinatorial regulation effects that govern their behavior."

    :abstractText: "Biological data, such as gene expression profiles or protein sequences, is often organized in a hierarchy of classes, where the instances assigned to \"nearby\" classes in the tree are similar. Most approaches for constructing a hierarchy use simple local operations, that are very sensitive to noise or variation in the data. In this paper, we describe probabilistic abstraction hierarchies (PAH) [11], a general probabilistic framework for clustering data into a hierarchy, and show how it can be applied to a wide variety of biological data sets. In a PAH, each class is associated with a probabilistic generative model for the data in the class. The PAH clustering algorithm simultaneously optimizes three things: the assignment of data instances to clusters, the models associated with the clusters, and the structure of the PAH approach is that it utilizes global optimization algorithms for the last two steps, substantially reducing the sensitivity to noise and the propensity to local maxima. We show how to apply this framework to gene expression data, protein sequence data, and HIV protease sequence data. We also show how our framework supports hierarchies involving more than one type of data. We demonstrate that our method extracts useful biological knowledge and is substantially more robust than hierarchical agglomerative clustering."

    :abstractText: Estimating the result size of complex queries that involve selection on multiple attributes and the join of several relations is a difficult but fundamental task in database query processing. It arises in cost-based query optimization, query profiling, and approximate query answering. In this paper, we show how probabilistic graphical models can be effectively used for this task as an accurate and compact approximation of the joint frequency distribution of multiple attributes across multiple relations. Probabilistic Relational Models (PRMs) are a recent development that extends graphical statistical models such as Bayesian Networks to relational domains. They represent the statistical dependencies between attributes within a table, and between attributes across foreign-key joins. We provide an efficient algorithm for constructing a PRM front a database, and show how a PRM can be used to compute selectivity estimates for a broad class of queries. One of the major contributions of this work is a unified framework for the estimation of queries involving both select and foreign-key join operations. Furthermore, our approach is not limited to answering a small set of predetermined queries; a single model can be used to effectively estimate the sizes of a wide collection of potential queries across multiple tables. We present results for our approach on several real-world databases. For both single-table multi-attribute queries and a general class of select-join queries, our approach produces more accurate estimates than standard approaches to selectivity estimation, using comparable space and time.

    :abstractText: "Motivated by problems that arise in computing degrees of belief, we consider the problem of computing asymptotic conditional probabilities for first-order formulas. That is, given first-order formulas &fgr; and &thgr;, we consider the number of structures with domain {1,&hellip;,N} that satisfy &thgr;, and compute the fraction of them in which &fgr; is true. We then consider what happens to this probability of first-order formulas, except that now we are considering asymptotic conditional probabilities. Although work has been done on special cases of asymptotic conditional probabilities, no general theory has been developed. This is probably due in part to the fact that it has been known that, if there is a binary predicate symbol in the vocabulary, asymptotic conditional probabilities do not always exist. We show that in this general case, almost all the questions one might want to ask (such as deciding whether the asymptotic probability exists) are highly undecidable. On the other hand, we show that the situation with unary predicates only is much better. If the vocabulary consists only of unary predicate and constant symbols, it is decidable whether the limit exists, and if it does, there is an effective algorithm for computing it. The complexity depends on two parameters: whether there is a fixed finite vocabulary or an infinite one, and whether there is a bound on the depth of quantifier nesting."

    :abstractText: The subject of this paper is finding small sample spaces for joint distributions of n discrete random variables. Such distributions are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form Pr (Event) = $\pi$. It is shown that the problem of deciding whether there exists any distribution satisfying a given set of constraints is NP-hard. However, if the constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them, which is supported by a "small" sample space (one whose cardinality is equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of independent random variables, a small sample space can be constructed in polynomial time. This last result can be used to derandomize algorithms; this is demonstrated by an application to the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs.

    :abstractText: Methods for learning Bayesian networks can discover dependency structure between observed variables. Although these methods are useful in many applications, they run into computational and statistical problems in domains that involve a large number of variables. In this paper, we consider a solution that is applicable when many variables have similar behavior. We introduce a new class of models, module networks, that explicitly partition the variables into modules, so that the variables in each module share the same parents in the network and the same conditional probability distribution. We define the semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns the modules' composition and their dependency structure from data. Evaluation on real data in the domains of gene expression and the stock market shows that module networks generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network structure reveals regularities that are obscured in learned Bayesian networks.

    :abstractText: We address the problem of unsupervised learning of complex articulated object models from 3D range data. We describe an algorithm whose input is a set of meshes corresponding to different configurations of an articulated object. The algorithm automatically recovers a decomposition of the object into approximately rigid parts, the location of the parts in the different object instances, and the articulated object skeleton linking the parts. Our algorithm first registers all the meshes using an unsupervised non-rigid technique described in a companion paper. It then segments the meshes using a graphical model that captures the spatial contiguity of parts. The segmentation is done using the EM algorithm, iterating between finding a decomposition of the object into rigid parts, and finding the location of the parts in the object instances. Although the graphical model is densely connected, the object decomposition step can be performed optimally and efficiently, allowing us to identify a large number of object parts while avoiding local maxima. We demonstrate the algorithm on real world datasets, recovering a 15-part articulated model of a human puppet from just 7 different puppet configurations, as well as a 4 part model of a flexing arm where significant non-rigid deformation was present.

    :abstractText: Obtaining labeled data is a significant obstacle for many NLP tasks. Recently, online games have been proposed as a new way of obtaining labeled data; games attract users by being fun to play. In this paper, we consider the application of this idea to collecting semantic relations between words, such as hypernym/hyponym relationships. We built three online games, inspired by the real-life games of Scattergories&trade; and Taboo&trade;. As of June 2008, players have entered nearly 800,000 data instances, in two categories. The first type of data consists of category/answer pairs ("Types of vehicle","car"), while the second is essentially free association data ("submarine","underwater"). We analyze both types of data in detail and discuss potential uses of the data. We show that we can extract from our data set a significant number of new hypernym/hyponym pairs not already found in WordNet.

    :abstractText: Multi-class image segmentation has made significant advances in recent years through the combination of local and global features. One important type of global feature is that of inter-class spatial relationships. For example, identifying "tree" pixels indicates that pixels above and to the sides are more likely to be "sky" whereas pixels below are more likely to be "grass." Incorporating such global information across the entire image and between all classes is a computational challenge as it is image-dependent, and hence, cannot be precomputed.In this work we propose a method for capturing global information from inter-class spatial relationships and encoding it as a local feature. We employ a two-stage classification process to label all image pixels. First, we generate predictions which are used to compute a local relative location feature from learned relative location maps. In the second stage, we combine this with appearance-based features to provide a final segmentation. We compare our results to recent published results on several multi-class image segmentation databases and show that the incorporation of relative location information allows us to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art.

    :abstractText: "Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula \xCE\xA6 holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,..., N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which \xCE\xA6 is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying \xCE\xA6 and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods."

    :abstractText: This paper addresses the problem of planning under uncertainty in large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Factored MDPs represent a complex state space using state variables and the transition model using a dynamic Bayesian network. This representation often allows an exponential reduction in the representation size of structured MDPs, but the complexity of exact solution algorithms for such MDPs can grow exponentially in the representation size. In this paper, we present two approximate solution algorithms that exploit structure in factored MDPs. Both use an approximate value function represented as a linear combination of basis functions, where each basis function involves only a small subset of the domain variables. A key contribution of this paper is that it shows how the basic operations of both algorithms can be performed efficiently in closed form, by exploiting both additive and context-specific structure in a factored MDP. A central element of our algorithms is a novel linear program decomposition technique, analogous to variable elimination in Bayesian networks, which reduces an exponentially large LP to a provably equivalent, polynomial-sized one. One algorithm uses approximate linear programming, and the second approximate dynamic programming. Our dynamic programming algorithm is novel in that it uses an approximation based on max-norm, a technique that more directly minimizes the terms that appear in error bounds for approximate MDP algorithms. We provide experimental results on problems with over 1040 states, demonstrating a promising indication of the scalability of our approach, and compare our algorithm to an existing state-of-the-art approach, showing, in some problems, exponential gains in computation time.

    :abstractText: "Non-deductive reasoning systems are often representation dependent: representing the same situation in two different ways may cause such a system to return two different answers. Some have viewed this as a significant problem. For example, the principle of maximum entropy has been subjected to much criticism due to its representation dependence. There has, however, been almost no work investigating representation dependence. In this paper, we formalize this notion and show that it is not a problem specific to maximum entropy. In fact, we show that any representation-independent probabilistic inference procedure that ignores irrelevant information is essentially entailment, in a precise sense. Moreover, we show that representation independence is incompatible with even a weak default assumption of independence. We then show that invariance under a restricted class of representation changes can form a reasonable compromise between representation independence and other desiderata, and provide a construction of a family of inference procedures that provides such restricted representation independence, using relative entropy."

    :abstractText: Structured game representations have recently attracted interest as models for multi-agent artificial intelligence scenarios, with rational behavior most commonly characterized by Nash equilibria. This paper presents efficient, exact algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in structured game representations, including both graphical games and multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs). The algorithms are derived from a continuation method for normal-form and extensive-form games due to Govindan and Wilson; they follow a trajectory through a space of perturbed games and their equilibria, exploiting game structure through fast computation of the Jacobian of the payoff function. They are theoretically guaranteed to find at least one equilibrium of the game, and may find more. Our approach provides the first efficient algorithm for computing exact equilibria in graphical games with arbitrary topology, and the first algorithm to exploit fine-grained structural properties of MAIDs. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithms and comparing them to predecessors. The running time of the graphical game algorithm is similar to, and often better than, the running time of previous approximate algorithms. The algorithm for MAIDs can effectively solve games that are much larger than those solvable by previous methods.

    :abstractText: "Most real-world data is heterogeneous and richly interconnected. Examples include the Web, hypertext, bibliometric data and social networks. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work with \"flat\" data representations, forcing us to convert our data into a form that loses much of the link structure. The recently introduced framework of probabilistic relational models (PRMs) embraces the object-relational nature of structured data by capturing probabilistic interactions between attributes of related entities. In this paper, we extend this framework by modeling interactions between the attributes and the link structure itself. An advantage of our approach is a unified generative model for both content and relational structure. We propose two mechanisms for representing a probabilistic distribution over link structures: reference uncertainty and existence uncertainty. We describe the appropriate conditions for using each model and present learning algorithms for each. We present experimental results showing that the learned models can be used to predict link structure and, moreover, the observed link structure can be used to provide better predictions for the attributes in the model."

    :abstractText: Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using <em>pool-based active learning</em>. Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a <em>version space</em>. We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.

    :abstractText: Methods for learning Bayesian networks can discover dependency structure between observed variables. Although these methods are useful in many applications, they run into computational and statistical problems in domains that involve a large number of variables. In this paper, we consider a solution that is applicable when many variables have similar behavior. We introduce a new class of models, module networks, that explicitly partition the variables into modules, so that the variables in each module share the same parents in the network and the same conditional probability distribution. We define the semantics of module networks, and describe an algorithm that learns the modules' composition and their dependency structure from data. Evaluation on real data in the domains of gene expression and the stock market shows that module networks generalize better than Bayesian networks, and that the learned module network structure reveals regularities that are obscured in learned Bayesian networks.

    :abstractText: We study the computational and sample complexity of parameter and structure learning in graphical models. Our main result shows that the class of factor graphs with bounded degree can be learned in polynomial time and from a polynomial number of training examples, assuming that the data is generated by a network in this class. This result covers both parameter estimation for a known network structure and structure learning. It implies as a corollary that we can learn factor graphs for both Bayesian networks and Markov networks of bounded degree, in polynomial time and sample complexity. Importantly, unlike standard maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, our method does not require inference in the underlying network, and so applies to networks where inference is intractable. We also show that the error of our learned model degrades gracefully when the generating distribution is not a member of the target class of networks. In addition to our main result, we show that the sample complexity of parameter learning in graphical models has an O(1) dependence on the number of variables in the model when using the KL-divergence normalized by the number of variables as the performance criterion.

    :abstractText: Motivated by problems that arise in computing degrees of belief, we consider the problem of computing asymptotic conditional probabilities for first-order sentences. Given first-order sentences $\phi$ and $\theta$, we consider the structures with domain $\{1,\ldots, N\}$ that satisfy $\theta$, and compute the fraction of them in which $\phi$ is true. We then consider what happens to this fraction as $N$ gets large. This extends the work on 0-1 laws that considers the limiting probability of first-order sentences, by considering asymptotic conditional probabilities. As shown by Liogon'kii [Math. Notes Acad. USSR, 6 (1969), pp.\ 856--861] and by Grove, Halpern, and Koller [Res. Rep. RJ 9564, IBM Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA, 1993], in the general case, asymptotic conditional probabilities do not always exist, and most questions relating to this issue are highly undecidable. These results, however, all depend on the assumption that $\theta$ can use a nonunary predicate symbol. Liogonkii\ [Math. Notes Acad. USSR, 6 (1969), pp.\ 856--861] shows that if we condition on formulas $\theta$ involving unary predicate symbols only (but no equality or constant symbols), then the asymptotic conditional probability does exist and can be effectively computed. This is the case even if we place no corresponding restrictions on $\phi$. We extend this result here to the case where $\theta$ involves equality and constants. We show that the complexity of computing the limit depends on various factors, such as the depth of quantifier nesting, or whether the vocabulary is finite or infinite. We completely characterize the complexity of the problem in the different cases, and show related results for the associated approximation problem.

    :abstractText: The subject of this paper is finding small sample spaces for joint distributions of n discrete random variables. Such distributions are often only required to obey a certain limited set of constraints of the form Pr (Event) = $\pi$. It is shown that the problem of deciding whether there exists any distribution satisfying a given set of constraints is NP-hard. However, if the constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them, which is supported by a "small" sample space (one whose cardinality is equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of independent random variables, a small sample space can be constructed in polynomial time. This last result can be used to derandomize algorithms; this is demonstrated by an application to the problem of finding large independent sets in sparse hypergraphs.

    :abstractText: Conditional logics play an important role in recent attempts to formulate theories of default reasoning. This paper investigates first-order conditional logic. We show that, as for first-order probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as &ldquo;most birds fly&rdquo;), and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as &ldquo;I believe that Tweety is unlikely to fly&rdquo;). We then address the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional logic. As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics. To study the problem in a coherent way, we use plausibility structures. These provide us with a general framework in which many of the standard approaches can be embedded. We show that while these standard approaches are all the same at the propositional level, they are significantly different in the context of a first-order language. Furthermore, we show that plausibilities provide the most natural extension of conditional logic to the first-order case:we provide a sound and complete axiomatization that contains only the KLM properties and standard axioms of first-order modal logic. We show that most of the other approaches have additional properties, which result in an inappropriate treatment of an infinitary version of the lottery paradox.

    :abstractText: We introduce the SCAPE method (Shape Completion and Animation for PEople)---a data-driven method for building a human shape model that spans variation in both subject shape and pose. The method is based on a representation that incorporates both articulated and non-rigid deformations. We learn a pose deformation model that derives the non-rigid surface deformation as a function of the pose of the articulated skeleton. We also learn a separate model of variation based on body shape. Our two models can be combined to produce 3D surface models with realistic muscle deformation for different people in different poses, when neither appear in the training set. We show how the model can be used for shape completion --- generating a complete surface mesh given a limited set of markers specifying the target shape. We present applications of shape completion to partial view completion and motion capture animation. In particular, our method is capable of constructing a high-quality animated surface model of a moving person, with realistic muscle deformation, using just a single static scan and a marker motion capture sequence of the person.

    :abstractText: Discriminative tasks, including object categorization and detection, are central components of high-level computer vision. However, sometimes we are interested in a finer-grained characterization of the object's properties, such as its pose or articulation. In this paper we develop a probabilistic method (LOOPS) that can learn a shape and appearance model for a particular object class, and be used to consistently localize constituent elements (landmarks) of the object's outline in test images. This localization effectively projects the test image into an alternative representational space that makes it particularly easy to perform various descriptive tasks. We apply our method to a range of object classes in cluttered images and demonstrate its effectiveness in localizing objects and performing descriptive classification, descriptive ranking, and descriptive clustering.

    :abstractText: Video encoding now is being implemented in various computing platforms with different computing capability, the requirement on the encoding complexity is also different according to different applications. As the most computation-intensive part of video encoding, the ME (motion estimation) should have a scalable complexity. This paper proposes a ME algorithm with fine-granular scalable complexity, a more important feature of the proposed algorithm is that it seeks for the complexity-distortion optimization. The given computation budget will be allocated to each MB (macroblock) in one frame. Each MB will consume its allocated computation by a hybrid search pattern. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can get a better computation-distortion performance than the existing ME algorithms

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of learning classifiers in structured domains, where some objects have a subset of features that are inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. Unlike the case where a feature exists but its value is not observed, here we focus on the case where a feature may not even exist (structurally absent) for some of the samples. The common approach for handling missing features in discriminative models is to first complete their unknown values, and then use a standard classification procedure over the completed data. This paper focuses on features that are known to be non-existing, rather than have an unknown value. We show how incomplete data can be classified directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate an objective function, based on the geometric interpretation of the margin, that aims to maximize the margin of each sample in its own relevant subspace. In this formulation, the linearly separable case can be transformed into a binary search over a series of second order cone programs (SOCP), a convex problem that can be solved efficiently. We also describe two approaches for optimizing the general case: an approximation that can be solved as a standard quadratic program (QP) and an iterative approach for solving the exact problem. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, both of these approaches could offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that the elegant handling of missing values by our approach allows it to both outperform other methods when the missing values have non-trivial structure, and be competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random. We demonstrate our results on several standard benchmarks and two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images."

    :abstractText: Techniques for robot monitoring and diagnosis have been developed that perform state estimation using probabilistic hybrid discrete/continuous models. Exact inference in hybrid dynamic systems is, in general, intractable. Approximate algorithms are based on either 1) greedy search, as in the case of k-best enumeration or 2) stochastic search, as in the case of Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering (RBPF). In this paper we propose a new method for hybrid state estimation. The key insight is that stochastic and greedy search methods, taken together, are often particularly effective in practice. The new method combines the stochastic methods of RBPF with the greedy search of k-best in order to create a method that is effective for a wider range of estimation problems than the individual methods alone. We demonstrate this robustness on a simulated acrobatic robot, and show that this benefit comes at only a small performance penalty.

    :abstractText: Camera networks are perhaps the most common type of sensor network and are deployed in a variety of real-world applications including surveillance, intelligent environments and scientific remote monitoring. A key problem in deploying a network of cameras is calibration, i.e., determining the location and orientation of each sensor so that observations in an image can be mapped to locations in the real world. This paper proposes a fully distributed approach for camera network calibration. The cameras collaborate to track an object that moves through the environment and reason probabilistically about which camera poses are consistent with the observed images. This reasoning employs sophisticated techniques for handling the difficult nonlinearities imposed by projective transformations, as well as the dense correlations that arise between distant cameras. Our method requires minimal overlap of the cameras' fields of view and makes very few assumptions about the motion of the object. In contrast to existing approaches, which are centralized, our distributed algorithm scales easily to very large camera networks. We evaluate the system on a real camera network with 25 nodes as well as simulated camera networks of up to 50 cameras and demonstrate that our approach performs well even when communication is lossy.

    :abstractText: Probabilistic hybrid discrete/continuous models, such as Concurrent Probabilistic Hybrid Automata (CPHA) are convenient tools for modeling complex robotic systems. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating the hybrid state of CPHA that achieves robustness by balancing greedy and stochastic search. To accomplish this, we (1) develop an efficient stochastic sampling approach for CPHA based on Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering, (2) perform an empirical comparison of the greedy and stochastic approaches to hybrid estimation and (3) propose a strategy for mixing stochastic and greedy search. The resulting method handles nonlinear dynamics, concurrently operating components and autonomous mode transitions. We demonstrate the robustness of the mixed method empirically.

    :abstractText: Internal localization, the problem of estimating relative pose for each module of a modular robot, is a prerequisite for many shape control, locomotion, and actuation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical approach that uses normalized cut to identify dense sub-regions with small mutual localization error, then progressively merges those sub-regions to localize the entire ensemble. Our method works well in both two and three dimensions, and requires neither exact measurements nor rigid inter-module connectors. Most of the computations in our method can be distributed effectively. The result is a robust algorithm that scales to large ensembles. We evaluate our algorithm in two- and three-dimensional simulations of scenarios with up to 10,000 modules.

This work is based on 1) open source vision code, 2) common computing hardware, and 3) inexpensive, consumer-quality cameras, and as such should be accessible to many robot builders."

    :abstractText: We demonstrate modular robot prototypes developed as part of the Claytronics Project (Goldstein et al. 2005). Among the novel features of these robots ("catoms") is their ability to reconfigure (move) relative to one another without moving parts. The absence of moving parts is central to one key aim of our work, namely, plausible manufacturability at smaller and smaller physical scales using high-volume. low-unit-cost techniques such as batch photolithography, multimaterial submicron 3D lithographic processing, and self assembly. Claytronics envisions multi-million-module robot ensembles able to form into three dimensional scenes, eventually with sufficient fidelity so as to convince a human observer the scenes are real. This work presents substantial challenges in mechanical and electronic design, control, programming, reliability, power delivery, and motion planning (among other areas), and holds the promise of radically altering the relationship between computation, humans, and the physical world.

    :abstractText: Most current sensor network research explores the use of extremely simple sensors on small devices called motes and focuses on over-coming the resource constraints of these devices. In contrast, our research explores the challenges of multimedia sensors and is motivated by the fact that multimedia devices, such as cameras, are rapidly becoming inexpensive, yet their use in a sensor network presents a number of unique challenges. For example, the data rates involved with multimedia sensors are orders of magnitude greater than those for sensor motes and this data cannot easily be processed by traditional sensor network techniques that focus on scalar data. In addition, the richness of the data generated by multimedia sensors makes them useful for a wide variety of applications. This paper presents an overview of IRISNET, a sensor network architecture that enables the creation of a planetary-scale infrastructure of multimedia sensors that can be shared by a large number of applications. To ensure the efficient collection of sensor readings, IRISNET enables the application-specific processing of sensor feeds on the significant computation resources that are typically attached to multimedia sensors. IRISNET enables the storage of sensor readings close to their source by providing a convenient and extensible distributed XML database infrastructure. Finally, IRISNET provides a number of multimedia processing primitives that enable the effective processing of sensor feeds in-network and at-sensor.

    :abstractText: We address how to write programs for distributed computing systems in which the network topology can change dynamically. Examples of such systems, which we call ensembles, include programmable sensor networks (where the network topology can change due to failures in the nodes or links) and modular robotics systems (whose physical configuration can be rearranged under program control). We extend Meld [1], a logic programming language that allows an ensemble to be viewed as a single computing system. In addition to proving some key properties of the language, we have also implemented a complete compiler for Meld. It generates code for TinyOS [14] and for a Claytronics simulator [12]. We have successfully written correct, efficient, and complex programs for ensembles containing over one million nodes.

    :abstractText: Distributed systems frequently exhibit properties of interest which span multiple entities. These properties cannot easily be recognized from any single entity, but can be readily detected by combining the knowledge of multiple entities. Testing for distributed properties is especially important in debugging or verifying software for modular robots. We have developed a technique we call distributed watchpoint triggers which can efficiently recognize distributed conditions. Our watchpoint description language can handle a variety of temporal, spatial and logical properties spanning multiple robots. In this paper we present the specification language, describe the distributed online mechanism for detecting distributed conditions in a running system and evaluate the performance of our implementation.

    :abstractText: Modular robot designers confront inherent tradeoffs between size and power. Smaller, more numerous modules increase the adaptability of a given volume or mass of robot, allowing the aggregate robot to take on a wider variety of configurations, but do so at a cost of reducing the power and complexity budget of each module. Fewer, larger modules can incorporate more powerful actuators and stronger hinges, but at a cost of overspecializing the resulting robot in favor of corresponding uses. In this paper we describe a technique for coordinating the efforts of many tiny modules to achieve forces and movements larger than those possible for individual modules. In a broad sense, our work aims to make actuator capacity and range at least partly fungible by algorithm design and ensemble topology, rather than being immutable properties of a particular module design. An important aspect of this technique is its ability to bend complex and large-scale structures and to realize the equivalent of large-scale joints. By enabling scalable joints, and the &#x201C;muscles&#x201D; that could actuate larger structures, our work makes it more likely that modular robot ensembles can successfully be scaled up in number and down in size.

    :abstractText: LDP (Locally Distributed Predicates) is a distributed, high-level language for programming modular reconfigurable robot systems (MRRs). In this paper we present the implementation of two motion-planning algorithms in LDP, and analyze both their performance and ease of implementation. We present multiple variations of one planner, including a novel resource allocation algorithm. We then draw conclusions about both the utility of the motion-planning algorithms and the suitability of LDP to the problem space. Our experiments suggest that metamodule-based planning approaches have a cost in time and/or energy terms, but that the cost can be worth paying in exchange for the additional generality and separation-of-concerns offered by these techniques. The particular tradeoff for a given system will depend upon its goals and the details of the underlying modules.

    :abstractText: "We present the theory behind TOD (the Temporal Object Discoverer), a novel unsupervised system that uses only temporal information to discover objects across image sequences acquired by any number of uncalibrated cameras. The process is divided into three phases: (1) Extraction of each pixel's <i>temporal signature</i>, a partition of the pixel's observations into sets that stem from different objects; (2) Construction of a global schedule that explains the signatures in terms of the lifetimes of a set of quasi-static objects; (3) Mapping of each pixel's observations to objects in the schedule according to the pixel's temporal signature. Our Global Scheduling (GSched) algorithm provably constructs a valid and complete global schedule when certain observability criteria are met. Our Quasi-Static Labeling (QSL) algorithm uses the schedule created by GSched to produce the maximally-informative mapping of each pixel's observations onto the objects they stem from. Using GSched and QSL, TOD ignores distracting motion, correctly deals with complicated occlusions, and naturally groups observations across cameras. The sets of 2D masks recovered are suitable for unsupervised training and initialization of object recognition and tracking systems."

    :abstractText: Learning application-specific distance metrics from labeled data is critical for both statistical classification and information retrieval. Most of the earlier work in this area has focused on finding metrics that simultaneously optimize compactness and separability in a global sense. Specifically, such distance metrics attempt to keep all of the data points in each class close together while ensuring that data points from different classes are separated. However, particularly when classes exhibit multimodal data distributions, these goals conflict and thus cannot be simultaneously satisfied. This paper proposes a Local Distance Metric (LDM) that aims to optimize local compactness and local separability. We present an efficient algorithm that employs eigenvector analysis, and bound optimization to learn the LDM from training data in a probabilistic framework. We demonstrate that LDM achieves significant improvements in both classification and retrieval accuracy compared to global distance learning and kernel-based KNN.

    :abstractText: Many computer vision applications, such as scene analysis and medical image interpretation, are ill-suited for traditional classification where each image can only be associated with a single class. This has stimulated recent work in multi-label learning where a given image can be tagged with multiple class labels. A serious problem with existing approaches is that they are unable to exploit correlations between class labels. This paper presents a novel framework for multi-label learning termed Correlated Label Propagation (CLP) that explicitly models interactions between labels in an efficient manner. As in standard label propagation, labels attached to training data points are propagated to test data points; however, unlike standard algorithms that treat each label independently, CLP simultaneously co-propagates multiple labels. Existing work eschews such an approach since naive algorithms for label co-propagation are intractable. We present an algorithm based on properties of submodular functions that efficiently finds an optimal solution. Our experiments demonstrate that CLP leads to significant gains in precision/recall against standard techniques on two real-world computer vision tasks involving several hundred labels.

    :abstractText: We describe how certain tasks in the audio domain can be effectively addressed using computer vision approaches. This paper focuses on the problem of music identification, where the goal is to reliably identify a song given a few seconds of noisy audio. Our approach treats the spectrogram of each music clip as a 2-D image and transforms music identification into a corrupted sub-image retrieval problem. By employing pairwise boosting on a large set of Viola-Jones features, our system learns compact, discriminative, local descriptors that are amenable to efficient indexing. During the query phase, we retrieve the set of song snippets that locally match the noisy sample and employ geometric verification in conjunction with an EM-based "occlusion" model to identify the song that is most consistent with the observed signal. We have implemented our algorithm in a practical system that can quickly and accurately recognize music from short audio samples in the presence of distortions such as poor recording quality andsignificant ambient noise. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in content-based music identification.

    :abstractText: Most text categorization methods require text content of documents that is often difficult to obtain. We consider "Collaborative Text Categorization", where each document is represented by the feedback from a large number of users. Our study focuses on the semi-supervised case in which one key challenge is that a significant number of users have not rated any labeled document. To address this problem, we examine several semi-supervised learning methods and our empirical study shows that collaborative text categorization is more effective than content-based text categorization and the manifold regularization is more effective than other state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

    :abstractText: This paper explores the concept of early discard for interactive search of unindexed data. Processing data inside storage devices using downloaded searchlet code enables Diamond to perform efficient, application-specific filtering of large data collections. Early discard helps users who are looking for "needles in a haystack" by eliminating the bulk of the irrelevant items as early as possible. A searchlet consists of a set of application-generated filters that Diamond uses to determine whether an object may be of interest to the user. The system optimizes the evaluation order of the filters based on run-time measurements of each filter's selectivity and computational cost. Diamond can also dynamically partition computation between the storage devices and the host computer to adjust for changes in hardware and network conditions. Performance numbers show that Diamond dynamically adapts to a query and to run-time system state. An informal user study of an image retrieval application supports our belief that early discard significantly improves the quality of interactive searches.

    :abstractText: We show that a simple, memory-based technique for appearance-based face recognition, motivated by the real-world task of visitor identification, can outperform more sophisticated algorithms that use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and neural networks. This technique is closely related to correlation templates; however, we show that the use of novel similarity measures greatly improves performance. We also show that augmenting the memory base with additional, synthetic face images results in further improvements in performance. Results of extensive empirical testing on two standard face recognition datasets are presented, and direct comparisons with published work show that our algorithm achieves comparable (or superior) results. Our system is incorporated into an automated visitor identification system that has been operating successfully in an outdoor environment since January 1999.

    :abstractText: "This paper studies the use of volumetric features as an alternative to popular local descriptor approaches for event detection in video sequences. Motivated by the recent success of similar ideas in object detection on static images, we generalize the notion of 2D box features to 3D spatio-temporal volumetric features. This general framework enables us to do real-time video analysis. We construct a real-time event detector for each action of interest by learning a cascade of filters based on volumetric features thatefficiently scans video sequences in space and time. This event detector recognizes actions that are traditionally problematic for interest point methods \xC2\xBF such as smooth motions where insufficient space-time interest points are available. Our experiments demonstrate that the technique accurately detects actions on real-world sequences and is robust to changes in viewpoint, scale and action speed. We also adapt our technique to the related task of human action classification and confirm that it achieves performance comparable to a current interest point based human activity recognizer on a standard database of human activities."

    :abstractText: We present the theory behind a novel unsupervised method for discovering quasi-static objects, objects that are stationary during some interval of observation, within image sequences acquired by any number of uncalibrated cameras. For each pixel we generate a signature that encodes the pixel's temporal structure. Using the set of temporal signatures gathered across views, we hypothesize a global schedule of events and a small set of objects whose arrivals and departures explain the events. The paper specifies observability conditions under which the global schedule can be established and presents the QSL algorithm that generates the maximally-informative mapping of pixels' observations onto the objects they stem from. Our framework ignores distracting motion, correctly deals with complicated occlusions, and naturally groups observations across cameras. The sets of 2D masks we recover are suitable for unsupervised training and initialization of object recognition and tracking systems.

    :abstractText: Many real-world tasks can be decomposed into pipelines of sequential operations (where sub-tasks may themselves be composed of one or more pipelines). JGram is a framework enabling rapid development of such multi-agent systems. Each agent's services are specified in the JGram Description Language (JDL), and automatically converted into Java source templates. These services may be invoked synchronously (analogous to function call) or asynchronously (analogous to message passing), in a manner that is transparent to the service's implementation. Complex tasks are created by composing several agent services into hierarchical JGram pipelines in which each agent may dynamically delegate its subtasks to other agents in a recursive manner, and in which errors are handled by a cross-agent, exception mechanism. Although JGram agents communicate using Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) protocol, the framework provides significant enhancements such as authentication, encrypted channels, and dynamic service specification. JGram has been used to develop several real-world agent systems. This paper discusses ARGUS, a visitor identification system that integrates a security camera with face detection, face recognition and user notification systems to automatically identify regular visitors arriving at the front door of our building.

    :abstractText: We introduce a system for near-duplicate detection and sub-image retrieval. Such a system is useful for finding copyright violations and detecting forged images. We define near-duplicate as images altered with common transformations such as changing contrast, saturation, scaling, cropping, framing, etc. Our system builds a parts-based representation of images using <i>distinctive local descriptors</i> which give high quality matches even under severe transformations. To cope with the large number of features extracted from the images, we employ <i>locality-sensitive hashing</i> to index the local descriptors. This allows us to make approximate similarity queries that only examine a small fraction of the database. Although locality-sensitive hashing has excellent theoretical performance properties, a standard implementation would still be unacceptably slow for this application. We show that, by optimizing layout and access to the index data on disk, we can efficiently query indices containing millions of keypoints. Our system achieves near-perfect accuracy (100% precision at 99.85% recall) on the tests presented in Meng <i>et al.</i> [16], and consistently strong results on our own, significantly more challenging experiments. Query times are interactive even for collections of thousands of images.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a vision-based geometric alignment system for aligning the projectors in an arbitrarily large display wall. Existing algorithms typically rely on a single camera view and degrade in accuracy1 as the display resolution exceeds the camera resolution by several orders of magnitude. Na&iuml;ve approaches to integrating multiple zoomed camera views fail since small errors in aligning adjacent views propagate quickly over the display surface to create glaring discontinuities. Our algorithm builds and refines a camera homography2 tree to automatically register any number of uncalibrated camera images; the resulting system is both faster and significantly more accurate than competing approaches, reliably achieving alignment errors of 0.55 pixels on a 24-projector display in under 9 minutes. Detailed experiments compare our system to two recent display wall alignment algorithms, both on our 18 Megapixel display wall and in simulation. These results indicate that our approach achieves sub-pixel accuracy even on displays with hundreds of projectors.

    :abstractText: We propose a novel framework for 3D reassembly, the task of assembling a solid object from its broken pieces. The primary challenge in this under-explored problem is to robustly establish compatibility between parts from one object. Feature-based techniques have shown success in domains such as 3D similarity search; unfortunately, the global features typically employed to quantify whole-object similarity are unsuitable for identifying part-level compatibility. Therefore, we propose the use of local features which, in conjunction with robust matching, have become popular for object recognition in 2D images. This paper demonstrates that an analogous framework can be successful for 3D reassembly. Automating part-level compatibility enables the construction of an interactive system for 3D reassembly, where the user can easily assemble a desired object from a large collection of pieces (many of which are irrelevant) by iteratively selecting compatible parts. We evaluate our approach on a simulated database of broken objects and show that it scales well in the presence of noise and extraneous pieces.

    :abstractText: Recent research in automated highway systems has ranged from low-level vision-based controllers to high-level route-guidance software. However, there is currently no system for tactical-level reasoning. Such a system should address tasks such as passing cars, making exits on time, and merging into a traffic stream. Many previous approaches have attempted to hand construct large rule-based systems which capture the interactions between multiple input sensors, dynamic and potentially conflicting subgoals, and changing roadway conditions. However, these systems are extremely difficult to design due to the large number of rules, the manual tuning of parameters within the rules, and the complex interactions between the rules. Our approach to this intermediate-level planning is a system which consists of a collection of autonomous agents, each of which specializes in a particular aspect of tactical driving. Each agent examines a subset of the intelligent vehicle&lsquo;s sensors and independently recommends driving decisions based on their local assessment of the tactical situation. This distributed framework allows different reasoning agents to be implemented using different algorithms.When using a collection of agents to solve a single task, it is vital to carefully consider the interactions between the agents. Since each reasoning object contains several internal parameters, manually finding values for these parameters while accounting for the agents&lsquo; possible interactions is a tedious and error-prone task. In our system, these parameters, and the system&lsquo;s overall dependence on each agent, is automatically tuned using a novel evolutionary optimization strategy, termed Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL).Our system, which employs multiple automatically trained agents, can competently drive a vehicle, both in terms of the user-defined evaluation metric, and as measured by their behavior on several driving situations culled from real-life experience. In this article, we describe a method for multiple agent integration which is applied to the automated highway system domain. However, it also generalizes to many complex robotics tasks where multiple interacting modules must simultaneously be configured without individual module feedback.

    :abstractText: "A major problem with interactive displays based on front projection is that users cast undesirable shadows on the display surface. This paper demonstrates that shadows can be muted by redundantly illuminating the display surface using multiple projectors, all mounted at different locations. However, this technique alone does not eliminate shadows: Multiple projectors create multiple dark regions on the surface (penumbral occlusions) and cast undesirable light onto the users. These problems can be solved by eliminating shadows and suppressing the light that falls on occluding users by actively modifying the projected output. This paper categorizes various methods that can be used to achieve redundant illumination, shadow elimination, and blinding light suppression and evaluates their performance."

    :abstractText: "This paper examines how computation can be mapped across the nodes of a distributed search system to effectively utilize available resources. We specifically address computationally intensive search of complex data, such as content-based retrieval of digital images or sounds, where sophisticated algorithms must be evaluated on the objects of interest. Since these problems require significant computation, we distribute the search over a collection of compute nodes, such as active storage devices, intermediate processors and host computers. A key challenge with mapping the desired computation to the available resources is that the most efficient distribution depends on several factors: relative power and number of compute nodes; network bandwidth between the compute nodes; the cost of evaluating query predicates; and the selectivity of the given query. This wide range of variables renders manual partitioning of the computation infeasible, particularly since some of the parameters (e.g., available network bandwidth) can change during the course of a search. This paper proposes several techniques for dynamic partitioning of computation, and demonstrates that they can significantly improve efficiency for distributed search applications."

    :abstractText: Vision-based user interfaces enable natural interaction modalities such as gestures. Such interfaces require computationally intensive video processing at low latency. We demonstrate an application that recognizes gestures to control TV operations. Accurate recognition is achieved by using a new descriptor called MoSIFT, which explicitly encodes optical flow with appearance features. MoSIFT is computationally expensive - a sequential implementation runs 100 times slower than real time. To reduce latency sufficiently for interaction, the application is implemented on a runtime system that exploits the parallelism inherent in video understanding applications.

    :abstractText: "Similarity measurement is a critical component in content-based image retrieval systems, and learning a good distance metric can significantly improve retrieval performance. However, despite extensive study, there are several major shortcomings with the existing approaches for distance metric learning that can significantly affect their application to medical image retrieval. In particular, \xE2\x80\x9Csimilarity\xE2\x80\x9D can mean very different things in image retrieval: resemblance in visual appearance (e.g., two images that look like one another) or similarity in semantic annotation (e.g., two images of tumors that look quite different yet are both malignant). Current approaches for distance metric learning typically address only one goal without consideration of the other. This is problematic for medical image retrieval where the goal is to assist doctors in decision making. In these applications, given a query image, the goal is to retrieve similar images from a reference library whose semantic annotations could provide the medical professional with greater insight into the possible interpretations of the query image. If the system were to retrieve images that did not look like the query, then users would be less likely to trust the system; on the other hand, retrieving images that appear superficially similar to the query but are semantically unrelated is undesirable because that could lead users toward an incorrect diagnosis. Hence, learning a distance metric that preserves both visual resemblance and semantic similarity is important. We emphasize that, although our study is focused on medical image retrieval, the problem addressed in this work is critical to many image retrieval systems. We present a boosting framework for distance metric learning that aims to preserve both visual and semantic similarities. The boosting framework first learns a binary representation using side information, in the form of labeled pairs, and then computes the distance as a weighted Hamming distance using the learned binary representation. A boosting algorithm is presented to efficiently learn the distance function. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on a mammographic image reference library with an Interactive Search-Assisted Decision Support (ISADS) system and on the medical image data set from ImageCLEF. Our results show that the boosting framework compares favorably to state-of-the-art approaches for distance metric learning in retrieval accuracy, with much lower computational cost. Additional evaluation with the COREL collection shows that our algorithm works well for regular image data sets."

    :abstractText: "We describe a point-based policy iteration (PBPI) algorithm for infinite-horizon POMDPs. PBPI replaces the exact policy improvement step of Hansen's policy iteration with point-based value iteration (PBVI). Despite being an approximate algorithm, PBPI is monotonic: At each iteration before convergence, PBPI produces a policy for which the values increase for at least one of a finite set of initial belief states, and decrease for none of these states. In contrast, PBVI cannot guarantee monotonic improvement of the value function or the policy. In practice PBPI generally needs a lower density of point coverage in the simplex and tends to produce superior policies with less computation. Experiments on several benchmark problems (up to 12,545 states) demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the PBPI algorithm."

    :abstractText: Machine learning methods are often applied to the problem of learning a map from a robot's sensor data, but they are rarely applied to the problem of learning a robot's motion model. The motion model, which can be influenced by robot idiosyncrasies and terrain properties, is a crucial aspect of current algorithms for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). In this paper we concentrate on generating the correct motion model for a robot by applying EM methods in conjunction with a current SLAM algorithm. In contrast to previous calibration approaches, we not only estimate the mean of the motion, but also the interdependencies between motion terms, and the variances in these terms. This can be used to provide a more focused proposal distribution to a particle filter used in a SLAM algorithm, which can reduce the resources needed for localization while decreasing the chance of losing track of the robot's position. We validate this approach by recovering a good motion model despite initialization with a poor one. Further experiments validate the generality of the learned model in similar circumstances.

    :abstractText: We present a novel, laser range finder based algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for mobile robots. SLAM addresses the problem of constructing an accurate map in real time despite imperfect information about the robot's trajectory through the environment. Unlike other approaches that assume predetermined landmarks (and must deal with a resulting data-association problem) our algorithm is purely laser based. Our algorithm uses a particle filter to represent both robot poses and possible map configurations. By using a new map representation, which we call distributed particle (DP) mapping, we are able to maintain and update hundreds of candidate maps and robot poses efficiently. The worst-case complexity of our algorithm per laser sweep is log-quadratic in the number of particles we maintain and linear in the area swept out by the laser. However, in practice our run time is usually much less than that. Our technique contains essentially no assumptions about the environment yet it is accurate enough to close loops of 60m in length with crisp, perpendicular edges on corridors and minimal or no misalignment errors.

    :abstractText: "The extensible mark-up language (XML) is gaining widespread use as a format for data exchange and storage on the World Wide Web. Queries over XML data require accurate selectivity estimation of path expressions to optimize query execution plans. Selectivity estimation of XML path expression is usually done based on summary statistics about the structure of the underlying XML repository. All previous methods require an off-line scan of the XML repository to collect the statistics. In this paper, we propose XPathLearner, a method for estimating selectivity of the most commonly used types of path expressions without looking at the XML data. XPathLearner gathers and refines the statistics using query feedback in an on-line manner and is especially suited to queries in Internet scale applications since the underlying XML repository is either inaccessible or too large to be scanned in its entirety. Besides the on-line property, our method also has two other novel features: (a) XPathLearner is workload-aware in collecting the statistics and thus can be more accurate than the more costly off-line method under tight memory constraints, and (b) XPathLearner automatically adjusts the statistics using query feedback when the underlying XML data change. We show empirically the estimation accuracy of our method using several real data sets."

    :abstractText: We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning for control problems which combines value-function approximation with linear architectures and approximate policy iteration. This new approach is motivated by the least-squares temporal-difference learning algorithm (LSTD) for prediction problems, which is known for its efficient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal-difference algorithms. Heretofore, LSTD has not had a straightforward application to control problems mainly because LSTD learns the state value function of a fixed policy which cannot be used for action selection and control without a model of the underlying process. Our new algorithm, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI), learns the state-action value function which allows for action selection without a model and for incremental policy improvement within a policy-iteration framework. LSPI is a model-free, off-policy method which can use efficiently (and reuse in each iteration) sample experiences collected in any manner. By separating the sample collection method, the choice of the linear approximation architecture, and the solution method, LSPI allows for focused attention on the distinct elements that contribute to practical reinforcement learning. LSPI is tested on the simple task of balancing an inverted pendulum and the harder task of balancing and riding a bicycle to a target location. In both cases, LSPI learns to control the pendulum or the bicycle by merely observing a relatively small number of trials where actions are selected randomly. LSPI is also compared against Q-learning (both with and without experience replay) using the same value function architecture. While LSPI achieves good performance fairly consistently on the difficult bicycle task, Q-learning variants were rarely able to balance for more than a small fraction of the time needed to reach the target location.

    :abstractText: A recent surge in research in kernelized approaches to reinforcement learning has sought to bring the benefits of kernelized machine learning techniques to reinforcement learning. Kernelized reinforcement learning techniques are fairly new and different authors have approached the topic with different assumptions and goals. Neither a unifying view nor an understanding of the pros and cons of different approaches has yet emerged. In this paper, we offer a unifying view of the different approaches to kernelized value function approximation for reinforcement learning. We show that, except for different approaches to regularization, Kernelized LSTD (KLSTD) is equivalent to a modelbased approach that uses kernelized regression to find an approximate reward and transition model, and that Gaussian Process Temporal Difference learning (GPTD) returns a mean value function that is equivalent to these other approaches. We also discuss the relationship between our modelbased approach and the earlier Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning (GPRL). Finally, we decompose the Bellman error into the sum of transition error and reward error terms, and demonstrate through experiments that this decomposition can be helpful in choosing regularization parameters.

    :abstractText: We study a multi-step hider-seeker game where the hider is moving on a graph and, in each step, the seeker is able to search c subsets of the graph nodes. We model this game as a zero-sum Bayesian game, which can be solved in weakly polynomial time in the players' action spaces. The seeker's action space is exponential in c, and both players' action spaces are exponential in the game horizon. To manage this intractability, we use a column/constraint generation approach for both players. This approach requires an oracle to determine best responses for each player. However, we show that computing a best response for the seeker is NP-hard, even for a single-step game when c is part of the input, and that computing a best response is NP-hard for both players for the multi-step game, even if c = 1. An integer programming formulation of the best response for the hider is practical for moderate horizons, but computing an exact seeker best response is impractical due to the exponential dependence on both c and the horizon. We therefore develop an approximate best response oracle with bounded suboptimality for the seeker. We prove performance bounds on the strategy that results when column/constraint generation with approximate best responses converges, and we measure the performance of our algorithm in simulations. In our experimental results, column/constraint generation converges to near-minimax strategies for both players fairly quickly.

    :abstractText: This paper proposes a novel framework to index and retrieve audio content from broadcast database that contains both speech and music. In this framework, we model the acoustic events using hidden Markov models, which are then used to decode the audio content. The decoding results in the form of acoustic token sequence and acoustic lattice are used to generate features for indexing and retrieval with the vector space model. Experiments were carried out on the TRECVID database and the results showed that the proposed framework is effective in audio information retrieval. The results also showed that the features generated from the acoustic lattice provide more accurate information than token sequence.

    :abstractText: Intrusion attempts due to self-propagating code are becoming an increasingly urgent problem, in part due to the homogeneous makeup of the internet. Recent advances in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have made use of the quickly spreading nature of these attacks to identify them with high sensitivity and at low false positive (FP) rates. However, slowly propagating attacks are much more difficult to detect because they are cloaked under the veil of normal network traffic, yet can be just as dangerous due to their exponential spread pattern. We extend the idea of using collaborative IDSs to corroborate the likelihood of attack by imbuing end hosts with probabilistic graphical models and using random messaging to gossip state among peer detectors. We show that such a system is able to boost a weak anomaly detector D to detect an order-of-magnitude slower worm, at false positive rates less than a few per week, than would be possible using D alone at the end-host or on a network aggregation point. We show that this general architecture is scalable in the sense that a fixed absolute false positive rate can be achieved as the network size grows, spreads communication bandwidth uniformly throughout the network, and makes use of the increased computation power of a distributed system. We argue that using probabilistic models provides more robust detections than previous collaborative counting schemes and allows the system to account for heterogeneous detectors in a principled fashion.

    :abstractText: Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action components can be solved efficiently by hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP). The main idea of the approach is to approximate the optimal value function by a Set of basis functions and optimize their weights by linear programming. The quality of this approximation naturally depends on its basis functions. However, basis functions leading to good approximations are rarely known in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach that discovers these functions automatically. The method relies on a class of parametric basis function models, which are optimized using the dual formulation of a relaxed HALP. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two hybrid optimization problems and compare it to manually selected basis functions.

    :abstractText: Power management techniques for mobile appliances put the components of the systems into low power states to maximize battery life while minimizing the impact on the perceived performance of the devices. Static timeout policies are the state-of-the-art approach for solving power management problems. In this work, we propose adaptive timeout policies as a simple and efficient solution for fine-grained power management. As discussed in the paper, the policies reduce the latency of static timeout policies by nearly one half at the same power savings. This result can be also viewed as increasing the power savings of static timeout policies at the same latency target. The main objective of our work is to propose practical adaptive policies. Therefore, our adaptive solution is fast enough to be executed within less than one millisecond, and sufficiently simple to be deployed directly on a microcontroller. We validate our ideas on two recorded CPU activity traces, which involve more than 10 million entries each.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we study a sequential decision making problem. The objective is to maximize the average reward accumulated over time subject to temporal cost constraints. The novelty of our setup is that the rewards and constraints are controlled by an adverse opponent. To solve our problem in a practical way, we propose an expert algorithm that guarantees both a vanishing regret and a sublinear number of violated constraints. The quality of this solution is demonstrated on a real-world power management problem. Our results support the hypothesis that online learning with convex cost constraints can be performed successfully in practice.

    :abstractText: Hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) has recently emerged as a promising framework for solving large factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) with discrete and continuous state and action variables. Our work addresses its major computational bottleneck - constraint satisfaction in large structured domains of discrete and continuous variables. We analyze this problem and propose a novelMarkov chainMonte Carlo (MCMC) method for finding the most violated constraint of a relaxed HALP. This method does not require the discretization of continuous variables, searches the space of constraints intelligently based on the structure of factored MDPs, and its space complexity is linear in the number of variables. We test the method on a set of large control problems and demonstrate improvements over alternative approaches.

This personalization capability can be applied to enhance digital video recorders with show recommendations per family-member instead of per device or as an enabling technology for targeted advertising. Based on five 1-3 week data sets collected from real homes, using 372 features including key press codes, key press timing, and 3-axis acceleration parameters including dominant frequency, energy, mean, and variance, we show household member identification accuracy of 70-92% with a Max-Margin Markov Network (M3N) classifier.

    :abstractText: Although many real-world stochastic planning problems are more naturally formulated by hybrid models with both discrete and continuous variables, current state-of-the-art methods cannot adequately address these problems. We present the first framework that can exploit problem structure for modeling and solving hybrid problems efficiently. We formulate these problems as hybrid Markov decision processes (MDPs with continuous and discrete state and action variables), which we assume can be represented in a factored way using a hybrid dynamic Bayesian network (hybrid DBN). This formulation also allows us to apply our methods to collaborative multiagent settings. We present a new linear program approximation method that exploits the structure of the hybrid MDP and lets us compute approximate value functions more efficiently. In particular, we describe a new factored discretization of continuous variables that avoids the exponential blow-up of traditional approaches. We provide theoretical bounds on the quality of such an approximation and on its scale-up potential. We support our theoretical arguments with experiments on a set of control problems with up to 28-dimensional continuous state space and 22-dimensional action space.

In this paper, we describe a novel hybrid factored Markov decision process (MDP) model that allows for a compact representation of these problems, and a new hybrid approximate linear programming (HALP) framework that permits their efficient solutions. The central idea of HALP is to approximate the optimal value function by a linear combination of basis functions and optimize its weights by linear programming. We analyze both theoretical and computational aspects of this approach, and demonstrate its scale-up potential on several hybrid optimization problems.

Our goal is to develop techniques for coordinating teams of robots to execute this task in application domains such as clearing a building, for reasons of security or safety. To this end, we introduce a new class of searcher, the &#966;-searcher, which can be readily instantiated as a physical mobile robot. We present a detailed analysis of the pursuit-evasion problem using &#966;-searchers. We present the first complete search algorithm for a single &#966;-searcher, show how this algorithm can be extended to handle multiple searchers, and give examples of computed trajectories.

    :abstractText: We describe a generalization of extensive-form games that greatly increases representational power while still allowing efficient computation in the zero-sum setting. A principal feature of our generalization is that it places arbitrary convex optimization problems at decision nodes, in place of the finite action sets typically considered. The possibly-infinite action sets mean we must "forget" the exact action taken (feasible solution to the optimization problem), remembering instead only some statistic sufficient for playing the rest of the game optimally. Our new model provides an exponentially smaller representation for some games; in particular, we show how to compactly represent (and solve) extensive-form games with outcome uncertainty and a generalization of Markov decision processes to multi-stage adversarial planning games.

    :abstractText: Email client software is widely used for personal task management, a purpose for which it was not designed and is poorly suited. Past attempts to remedy the problem have focused on adding task management features to the client UI. RADAR uses an alternative approach modeled on a trusted human assistant who reads mail, identifies task-relevant message content, and helps manage and execute tasks. This paper describes the integration of diverse AI technologies and presents results from human evaluation studies comparing RADAR user performance to unaided COTS tool users and users partnered with a human assistant. As machine learning plays a central role in many system components, we also compare versions of RADAR with and without learning. Our tests show a clear advantage for learning-enabled RADAR over all other test conditions.

    :abstractText: Partially observable decentralized decision making in robot teams is fundamentally different from decision making in fully observable problems. Team members cannot simply apply single-agent solution techniques in parallel. Instead, we must turn to game theoretic frameworks to correctly model the problem. While partially observable stochastic games (POSGs) provide a solution model for decentralized robot teams, this model quickly becomes intractable. We propose an algorithm that approximates POSGs as a series of smaller, related Bayesian games, using heuristics such as QMDP to provide the future discounted value of actions. This algorithm trades off limited look-ahead in uncertainty for computational feasibility, and results in policies that are locally optimal with respect to the selected heuristic. Empirical results are provided for both a simple problem for which the full POSG can also be constructed, as well as more complex, robot-inspired, problems.

    :abstractText: This article presents an implemented multi-robot system for playing the popular game of laser tag. The object of the game is to search for and tag opponents that can move freely about the environment. The main contribution of this paper is a new particle filter algorithm for tracking the location of many opponents in the presence of pervasive occlusion. We achieve efficient tracking principally through a clever factorization of our posterior into roles that can be dynamically added and merged. When searching for opponents, the individual agents greedily maximize their information gain, using a negotiation technique for coordinating their search efforts. Experimental results are provided, obtained with a physical robot system in large-scale indoor environments and through simulation.

    :abstractText: Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs) form a general framework for planning for groups of cooperating agents that inhabit a stochastic and partially observable environment. Unfortunately, computing optimal plans in a DEC-POMDP has been shown to be intractable (NEXP-complete), and approximate algorithms for specific subclasses have been proposed. Many of these algorithms rely on an (approximate) solution of the centralized planning problem (i.e., treating the whole team as a single agent). We take a more decentralized approach, in which each agent only reasons over its own local state and some uncontrollable state features, which are shared by all team members. In contrast to other approaches, we model communication as an integral part of the agent's reasoning, in which the meaning of a message is directly encoded in the policy of the communicating agent. We explore iterative methods for approximately solving such models, and we conclude with some encouraging preliminary experimental results.

    :abstractText: "We develop a novel mechanism for coordinated, distributed multiagent planning. We consider problems stated as a collection of single-agent planning problems coupled by common soft constraints on resource consumption. (Resources may be real or fictitious, the latter introduced as a tool for factoring the problem). A key idea is to recast the distributed planning problem as learning in a repeated game between the original agents and a newly introduced group of adversarial agents who influence prices for the resources. The adversarial agents benefit from arbitrage: that is, their incentive is to uncover violations of the resource usage constraints and, by selfishly adjusting prices, encourage the original agents to avoid plans that cause such violations. If all agents employ no-regret learning algorithms in the course of this repeated interaction, we are able to show that our mechanism can achieve design goals such as social optimality (efficiency), budget balance, and Nash-equilibrium convergence to within an error which approaches zero as the agents gain experience. In particular, the agents' average plans converge to a socially optimal solution for the original planning task. We present experiments in a simulated network routing domain demonstrating our method's ability to reliably generate sound plans."

    :abstractText: "The success of reinforcement learning in practical problems depends on the ability to combine function approximation with temporal difference methods such as value iteration. Experiments in this area have produced mixed results; there have been both notable successes and notable disappointments. Theory has been scarce, mostly due to the difficulty of reasoning about function approximators that generalize beyond the observed data. We provide a proof of convergence for a wide class of temporal difference methods involving function approximators such as k-nearest-neighbor, and show experimentally that these methods can be useful. The proof is based on a view of function approximators as expansion or contraction mappings. In addition, we present a novel view of approximate value iteration: an approximate algorithm for one environment turns out to be an exact algorithm for a different environment."

    :abstractText: MDPs are an attractive formalization for planning, but realistic problems often have intractably large state spaces. When we only need a partial policy to get from a fixed start state to a goal, restricting computation to states relevant to this task can make much larger problems tractable. We introduce a new algorithm, Bounded RTDP, which can produce partial policies with strong performance guarantees while only touching a fraction of the state space, even on problems where other algorithms would have to visit the full state space. To do so, Bounded RTDP maintains both upper and lower bounds on the optimal value function. The performance of Bounded RTDP is greatly aided by the introduction of a new technique to efficiently find suitable upper bounds; this technique can also be used to provide informed initialization to a wide range of other planning algorithms.

    :abstractText: "In machine learning problems with tens of thousands of features and only dozens or hundreds of independent training examples, dimensionality reduction is essential for good learning performance. In previous work, many researchers have treated the learning problem in two separate phases: first use an algorithm such as singular value decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the data set, and then use a classification algorithm such as na&iuml;ve Bayes or support vector machines to learn a classifier. We demonstrate that it is possible to combine the two goals of dimensionality reduction and classification into a single learning objective, and present a novel and efficient algorithm which optimizes this objective directly. We present experimental results in fMRI analysis which show that we can achieve better learning performance and lower-dimensional representations than two-phase approaches can."

    :abstractText: Predictive state representations (PSRs) have recently been proposed as an alternative to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) for representing the state of a dynamical system (Littman et al., 2001). We present a learning algorithm that learns a PSR from observational data. Our algorithm produces a variant of PSRs called transformed predictive state representations (TPSRs). We provide an efficient principal-components-based algorithm for learning a TPSR, and show that TPSRs can perform well in comparison to Hidden Markov Models learned with Baum-Welch in a real world robot tracking task for low dimensional representations and long prediction horizons.

    :abstractText: "Quite a bit is known about minimizing different kinds of regret in experts problems, and how these regret types relate to types of equilibria in the multiagent setting of repeated matrix games. Much less is known about the possible kinds of regret in online convex programming problems (OCPs), or about equilibria in the analogous multiagent setting of repeated convex games. This gap is unfortunate, since convex games are much more expressive than matrix games, and since many important machine learning problems can be expressed as OCPs. In this paper, we work to close this gap: we analyze a spectrum of regret types which lie between external and swap regret, along with their corresponding equilibria, which lie between coarse correlated and correlated equilibrium. We also analyze algorithms for minimizing these regret types. As examples of our framework, we derive algorithms for learning correlated equilibria in polyhedral convex games and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. The former is exponentially more efficient than previous algorithms, and the latter is the first of its type."

    :abstractText: "Motivation: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the first eukaryotic organism to have its genome completely sequenced. Since then, several large-scale analyses of the yeast genome have provided extensive functional annotations of individual genes and proteins. One fundamental property of a protein is its subcellular localization, which provides critical information about how this protein works in a cell. An important project therefore was the creation of the yeast GFP fusion localization database by the University of California, San Francisco, USA (UCSF). This database provides localization data for 75% of the proteins believed to be encoded by the yeast genome. These proteins were classified into 22 distinct subcellular location categories by visual examination. Based on our past success at building automated systems to classify subcellular location patterns in mammalian cells, we sought to create a similar system for yeast. Results: We developed computational methods to automatically analyze the images created by the UCSF yeast GFP fusion localization project. The system was trained to recognize the same location categories that were used in that study. We applied the system to 2640 images, and the system gave the same label as the previous assignments to 2139 images (81%). When only the highest confidence assignments were considered, 94.7% agreement was observed. Visual examination of the proteins for which the two approaches disagree suggests that at least some of the automated assignments may be more accurate. The automated method provides an objective, quantitative and repeatable assignment of protein locations that can be applied to new collections of yeast images (e.g. for different strains or the same strain under different conditions). It is also important to note that this performance could be achieved without requiring colocalization with any marker proteins.

    :abstractText: "Relational learning is concerned with predicting unknown values of a relation, given a database of entities and observed relations among entities. An example of relational learning is movie rating prediction, where entities could include users, movies, genres, and actors. Relations encode users' ratings of movies, movies' genres, and actors' roles in movies. A common prediction technique given one pairwise relation, for example a #users x #movies ratings matrix, is low-rank matrix factorization. In domains with multiple relations, represented as multiple matrices, we may improve predictive accuracy by exploiting information from one relation while predicting another. To this end, we propose a collective matrix factorization model: we simultaneously factor several matrices, sharing parameters among factors when an entity participates in multiple relations. Each relation can have a different value type and error distribution; so, we allow nonlinear relationships between the parameters and outputs, using Bregman divergences to measure error. We extend standard alternating projection algorithms to our model, and derive an efficient Newton update for the projection. Furthermore, we propose stochastic optimization methods to deal with large, sparse matrices. Our model generalizes several existing matrix factorization methods, and therefore yields new large-scale optimization algorithms for these problems. Our model can handle any pairwise relational schema and a wide variety of error models. We demonstrate its efficiency, as well as the benefit of sharing parameters among relations."

    :abstractText: We present a unified view of matrix factorization that frames the differences among popular methods, such as NMF, Weighted SVD, E-PCA, MMMF, pLSI, pLSI-pHITS, Bregman co-clustering, and many others, in terms of a small number of modeling choices. Many of these approaches can be viewed as minimizing a generalized Bregman divergence, and we show that (i) a straightforward alternating projection algorithm can be applied to almost any model in our unified view; (ii) the Hessian for each projection has special structure that makes a Newton projection feasible, even when there are equality constraints on the factors, which allows for matrix co-clustering; and (iii) alternating projections can be generalized to simultaneously factor a set of matrices that share dimensions. These observations immediately yield new optimization algorithms for the above factorization methods, and suggest novel generalizations of these methods such as incorporating row and column biases, and adding or relaxing clustering constraints.

    :abstractText: "Shoham et al. identify several important agendas which can help direct research in multi-agent learning. We propose two additional agendas-called ''modelling'' and ''design''-which cover the problems we need to consider before our agents can start learning. We then consider research goals for modelling, design, and learning, and identify the problem of finding learning algorithms that guarantee convergence to Pareto-dominant equilibria against a wide range of opponents. Finally, we conclude with an example: starting from an informally-specified multi-agent learning problem, we illustrate how one might formalize and solve it by stepping through the tasks of modelling, design, and learning."

    :abstractText: Agents operating in the real world often have limited time available for planning their next actions. Producing optimal plans is infeasible in these scenarios. Instead, agents must be satisfied with the best plans they can generate within the time available. One class of planners well-suited to this task are anytime planners, which quickly find an initial, highly suboptimal plan, and then improve this plan until time runs out. A second challenge associated with planning in the real world is that models are usually imperfect and environments are often dynamic. Thus, agents need to update their models and consequently plans over time. Incremental planners, which make use of the results of previous planning efforts to generate a new plan, can substantially speed up each planning episode in such cases. In this paper, we present an A^*-based anytime search algorithm that produces significantly better solutions than current approaches, while also providing suboptimality bounds on the quality of the solution at any point in time. We also present an extension of this algorithm that is both anytime and incremental. This extension improves its current solution while deliberation time allows and is able to incrementally repair its solution when changes to the world model occur. We provide a number of theoretical and experimental results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in a robot navigation domain involving two physical systems. We believe that the simplicity, theoretical properties, and generality of the presented methods make them well suited to a range of search problems involving dynamic graphs.

    :abstractText: We study the visibility-based pursuit-evasion problem, in which one or more searchers must move through a given environment so as to guarantee detection of any and all evaders, which can move arbitrarily fast. Our goal is to develop techniques for coordinating teams of robots to execute this task in application domains such as clearing a building, for reasons of security or safety. To this end, we introduce a new class of searcher, the &#966;-searcher, which can be readily instantiated as a physical mobile robot. We present a detailed analysis of the pursuit-evasion problem using &#966;-searchers. We present the first complete search algorithm for a single &#966;-searcher, show how this algorithm can be extended to handle multiple searchers, and give examples of computed trajectories.

    :abstractText: Standard value function approaches to finding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are generally considered to be intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is to a large extent a consequence of computing an exact, optimal policy over the entire belief space. However, in real-world POMDP problems, computing the optimal policy for the full belief space is often unnecessary for good control even for problems with complicated policy classes. The beliefs experienced by the controller often lie near a structured, low-dimensional subspace embedded in the high-dimensional belief space. Finding a good approximation to the optimal value function for only this subspace can be much easier than computing the full value function. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by reducing the dimensionality of the belief space. We use Exponential family Principal Components Analysis (Collins, Dasgupta, & Schapire, 2002) to represent sparse, high-dimensional belief spaces using small sets of learned features of the belief state. We then plan only in terms of the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in this low-dimensional space, we can find policies for POMDP models that are orders of magnitude larger than models that can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and on mobile robot navigation tasks.

    :abstractText: The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process has long been recognized as a rich framework for real-world planning and control problems, especially in robotics. However exact solutions in this framework are typically computationally intractable for all but the smallest problems. A well-known technique for speeding up POMDP solving involves performing value backups at specific belief points, rather than over the entire belief simplex. The efficiency of this approach, however, depends greatly on the selection of points. This paper presents a set of novel techniques for selecting informative belief points which work well in practice. The point selection procedure is combined with point-based value backups to form an effective anytime POMDP algorithm called Point-Based Value Iteration (PBVI). The first aim of this paper is to introduce this algorithm and present a theoretical analysis justifying the choice of belief selection technique. The second aim of this paper is to provide a thorough empirical comparison between PBVI and other state-of-the-art POMDP methods, in particular the Perseus algorithm, in an effort to highlight their similarities and differences. Evaluation is performed using both standard POMDP domains and realistic robotic tasks.

    :abstractText: "A central problem in artificial intelligence is to plan to maximize future reward under uncertainty in a partially observable environment. Models of such environments include Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) [4] as well as their generalizations, Predictive State Representations (PSRs) [9] and Observable Operator Models (OOMs) [7]. POMDPs model the state of the world as a latent variable; in contrast, PSRs and OOMs represent state by tracking occurrence probabilities of a set of future events (called tests or characteristic events) conditioned on past events (called histories or indicative events). Unfortunately, exact planning algorithms such as value iteration [14] are intractable for most realistic POMDPs due to the curse of history and the curse of dimensionality [11]. However, PSRs and OOMs hold the promise of mitigating both of these curses: first, many successful approximate planning techniques designed to address these problems in POMDPs can easily be adapted to PSRs and OOMs [8, 6]. Second, PSRs and OOMs are often more compact than their corresponding POMDPs (i.e., need fewer state dimensions), mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Finally, since tests and histories are observable quantities, it has been suggested that PSRs and OOMs should be easier to learn than POMDPs; with a successful learning algorithm, we can look for a model which ignores all but the most important components of state, reducing dimensionality still further. In this paper we take an important step toward realizing the above hopes. In particular, we propose and demonstrate a fast and statistically consistent spectral algorithm which learns the parameters of a PSR directly from sequences of action-observation pairs. We then close the loop from observations to actions by planning in the learned model and recovering a policy which is near-optimal in the original environment. Closing the loop is a much more stringent test than simply checking short-term prediction accuracy, since the quality of an optimized policy depends strongly on the accuracy of the model: inaccurate models typically lead to useless plans."

    :abstractText: "In structured classification problems, there is a direct conflict between expressive models and efficient inference: while graphical models such as Markov random fields or factor graphs can represent arbitrary dependences among instance labels, the cost of inference via belief propagation in these models grows rapidly as the graph structure becomes more complicated. One important source of complexity in belief propagation is the need to marginalize large factors to compute messages. This operation takes time exponential in the number of variables in the factor, and can limit the expressiveness of the models we can use. In this paper, we study a new class of potential functions, which we call decomposable k-way potentials, and provide efficient algorithms for computing messages from these potentials during belief propagation. We believe these new potentials provide a good balance between expressive power and efficient inference in practical structured classification problems. We discuss three instances of decomposable potentials: the associative Markov network potential, the nested junction tree, and a new type of potential which we call the voting potential. We use these potentials to classify images of protein subcellular location patterns in groups of cells. Classifying subcellular location patterns can help us answer many important questions in computational biology, including questions about how various treatments affect the synthesis and behavior of proteins and networks of proteins within a cell. Our new representation and algorithm lead to substantial improvements in both inference speed and classification accuracy."

    :abstractText: Effective local search methods for finding satisfying assignments of CNF formulae exhibit several systematic characteristics in their search. We identify a series of measurable characteristics of local search behavior that are predictive of problem solving efficiency. These measures are shown to be useful for diagnosing inefficiencies in given search procedures, tuning parameters, and predicting the value of innovations to existing strategies. We then introduce a new local search method, SDF ("smoothed descent and flood"), that builds upon the intuitions gained by our study. SDF works by greedily descending in an informative objective (that considers how strongly clauses are satisfied, in addition to counting the number of unsatisfied clauses) and, once trapped in a local minima, "floods" this minima by re-weighting unsatisfied clauses to create a new descent direction. The resulting procedure exhibits superior local search characteristics under our measures. We show that this method can compete with the state of the art techniques, and significantly reduces the number of search steps relative to many recent methods. Copyright 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    :abstractText: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are an intuitive and general way to model sequential decision making problems under uncertainty. Unfortunately, even approximate planning in POMDPs is known to be hard, and developing heuristic planners that can deliver reasonable results in practice has proved to be a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to approximate value-iteration for POMDP planning that is based on quadratic rather than piecewise linear function approximators. Specifically, we approximate the optimal value function by a convex upper bound composed of a fixed number of quadratics, and optimize it at each stage by semidefinite programming. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive approximation quality to current techniques while still maintaining a bounded size representation of the function approximator. Moreover, an upper bound on the optimal value function can be preserved if required. Overall, the technique requires computation time and space that is only linear in the number of iterations (horizon time).

    :abstractText: One of the well known risks of large margin training methods, such as boosting and support vector machines (SVMs), is their sensitivity to outliers. These risks are normally mitigated by using a soft margin criterion, such as hinge loss, to reduce outlier sensitivity. In this paper, we present a more direct approach that explicitly incorporates outlier suppression in the training process. In particular, we show how outlier detection can be encoded in the large margin training principle of support vector machines. By expressing a convex relaxation of the joint training problem as a semide finite program, one can use this approach to robustly train a support vector machine while suppressing outliers. We demonstrate that our approach can yield superior results to the standard soft margin approach in the presence of outliers.

    :abstractText: "We present new unsupervised and semi-supervised training algorithms for multi-class support vector machines based on semidefinite programming. Although support vector machines (SVMs) have been a dominant machine learning technique for the past decade, they have generally been applied to supervised learning problems. Developing unsupervised extensions to SVMs has in fact proved to be difficult. In this paper, we present a principled approach to unsupervised SVM training by formulating convex relaxations of the natural training criterion: find a labeling that would yield an optimal SVM classifier on the resulting training data. The problem is hard, but semidefinite relaxations can approximate this objective surprisingly well. While previous work has concentrated on the two-class case, we present a general, multi-class formulation that can be applied to a wider range of natural data sets. The resulting training procedures are computationally intensive, but produce high quality generalization results."

    :abstractText: We present a new semi-supervised training procedure for conditional random fields (CRFs) that can be used to train sequence segmentors and labelers from a combination of labeled and unlabeled training data. Our approach is based on extending the minimum entropy regularization framework to the structured prediction case, yielding a training objective that combines unlabeled conditional entropy with labeled conditional likelihood. Although the training objective is no longer concave, it can still be used to improve an initial model (e.g. obtained from supervised training) by iterative ascent. We apply our new training algorithm to the problem of identifying gene and protein mentions in biological texts, and show that incorporating unlabeled data improves the performance of the supervised CRF in this case.

    :abstractText: "A popular form of policy evaluation for large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is the least-squares temporal differencing( TD) method. Least-squares TD methods handle large MDPs by requiring prior knowledge feature vectors which form a set of basis vectors that compress the system down to tractable levels. Model-based methods have largely been ignored in favour of model-free TD algorithms due to two perceived drawbacks: slower computation time and larger storage requirements. This paper challenges the perceived advantage of the temporal difference method over a model-based method in three distinct ways. First, it provides a new model-based approximate policy estimation method which produces solutions in a faster computation time than Boyan's least-squares TD method. Second, it introduces a new algorithm to derive basis vectors without any prior knowledge of the system. Third, we introduce an iteratively improving model-based value estimator that can run faster than standard TD methods. All algorithms require model storage but remain computationally competitive in terms of accuracy with model-free temporal differencing methods."

    :abstractText: We present a statistical method using n-gram language models to identify session boundaries in a large collection of Livelink log data. The identified sessions are then used for association rule learning. Unlike the traditional ad hoc timeout method, which uses fixed time thresholds for session identification, our method uses an information theoretic approach that provides a natural technique for performing dynamic session identification. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated with respect to 4 different interestingness measures. We find that we obtain a significant improvement in each interestingness measure, ranging from a 26.6% to 39% improvement on average over the best results obtained with standard timeout methods.

Our method is based on an on-line discriminative learning technique that is able to cope with illumination changes due to discontinuous switching, or illumination drifts caused by slower processes such as varying time of the day. Starting from a discriminative learning principle, we derive a training algorithm that, for each pixel, computes a weighted linear combination of selected past observations with time-decay. We present experimental results that show the proposed approach outperforms existing methods on both synthetic sequencse and real video data.

    :abstractText: It is commonly believed that word segmentation accuracy is monotonically related to retrieval performance in Chinese information retrieval. In this paper we show that, for Chinese, the relationship between segmentation and retrieval performance is in fact nonmonotonic; that is, at around 70% word segmentation accuracy an over-segmentation phenomenon begins to occur which leads to a reduction in information retrieval performance. We demonstrate this effect by presenting an empirical investigation of information retrieval on Chinese TREC data, using a wide variety of word segmentation algorithms with word segmentation accuracies ranging from 44% to 95%. It appears that the main reason for the drop in retrieval performance is that correct compounds and collocations are preserved by accurate segmenters, while they are broken up by less accurate (but reasonable) segmenters, to a surprising advantage. This suggests that words themselves might be too broad a notion to conveniently capture the general semantic meaning of Chinese text.

    :abstractText: The problem of learning linear-discriminant concepts can be solved by various mistake-driven update procedures, including the Winnow family of algorithms and the well-known Perceptron algorithm. In this paper we define the general class of &ldquo;quasi-additive&rdquo; algorithms, which includes Perceptron and Winnow as special cases. We give a single proof of convergence that covers a broad subset of algorithms in this class, including both Perceptron and Winnow, but also many new algorithms. Our proof hinges on analyzing a generic measure of progress construction that gives insight as to when and how such algorithms converge.Our measure of progress construction also permits us to obtain good mistake bounds for individual algorithms. We apply our unified analysis to new algorithms as well as existing algorithms. When applied to known algorithms, our method &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; produces close variants of existing proofs (recovering similar bounds)&mdash;thus showing that, in a certain sense, these seemingly diverse results are fundamentally isomorphic. However, we also demonstrate that the unifying principles are more broadly applicable, and analyze a new class of algorithms that smoothly interpolate between the additive-update behavior of Perceptron and the multiplicative-update behavior of Winnow.

    :abstractText: Images and other high-dimensional data can frequently be characterized by a low dimensional manifold (e.g. one that corresponds to the degrees of freedom of the camera). Recently, nonlinear manifold learning techniques have been used to map images to points in a lower dimension space, capturing some of the dynamics of the camera or the subjects. In general, these methods do not take advantage of any prior understanding of the dynamics we might have, relying instead on local Euclidean distances that can be misleading in image space. In practice, we frequently have some prior knowledge regarding the transformations that relate images (e.g. rotation, translation, etc). We present a method for augmenting existing embedding techniques with additional information derived from known transformations, either in the form of tangent spaces that locally characterize the manifold or distances derived from reconstruction errors. The extra information is incorporated directly into the cost function of the embedding technique. The techniques we augment are largely attractive because there is a closed form solution for their cost optimization. Our approach likewise produces a closed form solution for the augmented cost function. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of image data.

    :abstractText: We augment the naive Bayes model with an n-gram language model to address two shortcomings of naive Bayes text classifiers. The chain augmented naive Bayes classifiers we propose have two advantages over standard naive Bayes classifiers. First, a chain augmented naive Bayes model relaxes some of the independence assumptions of naive Bayes--allowing a local Markov chain dependence in the observed variables--while still permitting efficient inference and learning. Second, smoothing techniques from statistical language modeling can be used to recover better estimates than the Laplace smoothing techniques usually used in naive Bayes classification. Our experimental results on three real world data sets show that we achieve substantial improvements over standard naive Bayes classification, while also achieving state of the art performance that competes with the best known methods in these cases.

    :abstractText: We present a variational Bayesian framework for performing inference, density estimation and model selection in a special class of graphical models---Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRFs). HMRFs are particularly well suited to image modelling and in this paper, we apply them to the problem of image segmentation. Unfortunately, HMRFs are notoriously hard to train and use because the exact inference problems they create are intractable. Our main contribution is to introduce an efficient variational approach for performing approximate inference of the Bayesian formulation of HMRFs, which we can then apply to the density estimation and model selection problems that arise when learning image models from data. With this variational approach, we can conveniently tackle the problem of image segmentation. We present experimental results which show that our technique outperforms recent HMRF-based segmentation methods on real world images.

    :abstractText: We present an efficient "sparse sampling" technique for approximating Bayes optimal decision making in reinforcement learning, addressing the well known exploration versus exploitation tradeoff. Our approach combines sparse sampling with Bayesian exploration to achieve improved decision making while controlling computational cost. The idea is to grow a sparse lookahead tree, intelligently, by exploiting information in a Bayesian posterior---rather than enumerate action branches (standard sparse sampling) or compensate myopically (value of perfect information). The outcome is a flexible, practical technique for improving action selection in simple reinforcement learning scenarios.

    :abstractText: We present a directed Markov random field (MRF) model that combines n-gram models, probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) for the purpose of statistical language modeling. Even though the composite directed MRF model potentially has an exponential number of loops and becomes a context sensitive grammar, we are nevertheless able to estimate its parameters in cubic time using an efficient modified EM method, the generalized inside-outside algorithm, which extends the inside-outside algorithm to incorporate the effects of the n-gram and PLSA language models. We generalize various smoothing techniques to alleviate the sparseness of n-gram counts in cases where there are hidden variables. We also derive an analogous algorithm to calculate the probability of initial subsequence of a sentence, generated by the composite language model. Our experimental results on the Wall Street Journal corpus show that we obtain significant reductions in perplexity compared to the state-of-the-art baseline trigram model with Good-Turing and Kneser-Ney smoothings.

    :abstractText: We present a new unsupervised algorithm for training structured predictors that is discriminative, convex, and avoids the use of EM. The idea is to formulate an unsupervised version of structured learning methods, such as maximum margin Markov networks, that can be trained via semidefinite programming. The result is a discriminative training criterion for structured predictors (like hidden Markov models) that remains unsupervised and does not create local minima. To reduce training cost, we reformulate the training procedure to mitigate the dependence on semidefinite programming, and finally propose a heuristic procedure that avoids semidefinite programming entirely. Experimental results show that the convex discriminative procedure can produce better conditional models than conventional Baum-Welch (EM) training.

    :abstractText: We present a new approach to ensemble classification that requires learning only a single base classifier. The idea is to learn a classifier that simultaneously predicts pairs of test labels--as opposed to learning multiple predictors for single test labels-- then coordinating the assignment of individual labels by propagating beliefs on a graph over the data. We argue that the approach is statistically well motivated, even for independent identically distributed (iid) data. In fact, we present experimental results that show improvements in classification accuracy over single-example classifiers, across a range of iid data sets and over a set of base classifiers. Like boosting, the technique increases representational capacity while controlling variance through a principled form of classifier combination.

    :abstractText: We present new strategies for "probably approximately correct" (par) learning that use fewer training examples than previous approaches. The idea is to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide "on-line" when to return a hypothesis, rather than collect a large fixed-size training sample. This yields sequential learning procedures that par-learn by observing a small random number of examples. We provide theoretical bounds on the expected training sample size of our procedure -- but establish its efficiency primarily by a scries of experiments which show sequential learning actually uses many times fewer training examples in practice. These results demonstrate that pac-learning can be far more efficiently achieved in practice than previously thought.

    :abstractText: Boolean linear programs (BLPs) are ubiquitous in AI. Satisfiability testing, planning with resource constraints, and winner determination in combinatorial auctions are all examples of this type of problem. Although increasingly well-informed by work in OR, current AI research has tended to focus on specialized algorithms for each type of BLP task and has only loosely patterned new algorithms on effective methods from other tasks. In this paper we introduce a single general-purpose local search procedure that can be simultaneously applied to the entire range of BLP problems, without modification. Although one might suspect that a general-purpose algorithm might not perform as well as specialized algorithms, we find that this is not the case here. Our experiments show that our generic algorithm simultaneously achieves performance comparable with the state of the art in satisfiability search and winner determination in combinatorial auctions-- two very different BLP problems. Our algorithm is simple, and combines an old idea from OR with recent ideas from AI.

    :abstractText: "Gait optimization is a basic yet challenging problem for both quadrupedal and bipedal robots. Although techniques for automating the process exist, most involve local function optimization procedures that suffer from three key drawbacks. Local optimization techniques are naturally plagued by local optima, make no use of the expensive gait evaluations once a local step is taken, and do not explicitly model noise in gait evaluation. These drawbacks increase the need for a large number of gait evaluations, making optimization slow, data inefficient, and manually intensive. We present a Bayesian approach based on Gaussian process regression that addresses all three drawbacks. It uses a global search strategy based on a posterior model inferred from all of the individual noisy evaluations. We demonstrate the technique on a quadruped robot, using it to optimize two different criteria: speed and smoothness. We show in both cases our technique requires dramatically fewer gait evaluations than state-of-the-art local gradient approaches."

    :abstractText: Recently, significant progress has been made on learning structured predictors via coordinated training algorithms such as conditional random fields and maximum margin Markov networks. Unfortunately, these techniques are based on specialized training algorithms, are complex to implement, and expensive to run. We present a much simpler approach to training structured predictors by applying a boosting-like procedure to standard supervised training methods. The idea is to learn a local predictor using standard methods, such as logistic regression or support vector machines, but then achieve improved structured classification by "boosting" the influence of misclassified components after structured prediction, re-training the local predictor, and repeating. Further improvement in structured prediction accuracy can be achieved by incorporating "dynamic" features--i.e. an extension whereby the features for one predicted component can depend on the predictions already made for some other components. We apply our techniques to the problem of learning dependency parsers from annotated natural language corpora. By using logistic regression as an efficient base classifier (for predicting dependency links between word pairs), we are able to efficiently train a dependency parsing model, via structured boosting, that achieves state of the art results in English, and surpasses state of the art in Chinese.

Our approach uses simple information theoretic principles and achieves effective performance across a variety of languages and tasks without requiring feature selection or extensive pre-processing. To demonstrate the language and task independence of the proposed technique, we present experimental results on several languages---Greek, English, Chinese and Japanese---in several text categorization problems---language identification, authorship attribution, text genre classification, and topic detection. Our experimental results show that the simple approach achieves state of the art performance in each case.

    :abstractText: Learning the structure of a gene regulatory network from timeseries gene expression data is a significant challenge. Most approaches proposed in the literature to date attempt to predict the regulators of each target gene individually, but fail to share regulatory information between related genes. In this paper, we propose a new globally regularized risk minimization approach to address this problem. Our approach first clusters genes according to their time-series expression profiles--identifying related groups of genes. Given a clustering, we then develop a simple technique that exploits the assumption that genes with similar expression patterns are likely to be co-regulated by encouraging the genes in the same group to share common regulators. Our experiments on both synthetic and real gene expression data suggest that our new approach ismore effective at identifying important transcription factor based regulatory mechanisms than the standard independent approach and a prototype based approach.

    :abstractText: We propose a self-supervised word-segmentation technique for Chinese information retrieval. This method combines the advantages of traditional dictionary based approaches with character based approaches, while overcoming many of their shortcomings. Experiments on TREC data show comparable performance to both the dictionary based and the character based approaches. However, our method is language independent and unsupervised, which provides a promising avenue for constructing accurate multilingual information retrieval systems that are flexible and adaptive.

    :abstractText: We present a simple approach for Asian language text classification without word segmentation, based on statistical n-gram language modeling. In particular, we examine Chinese and Japanese text classification. With character n-gram models, our approach avoids word segmentation. However, unlike traditional ad hoc n-gram models, the statistical language modeling based approach has strong information theoretic basis and avoids explicit feature selection procedure which potentially loses significantly amount of useful information. We systematically study the key factors in language modeling and their influence on classification. Experiments on Chinese TREC and Japanese NTCIR topic detection show that the simple approach can achieve better performance compared to traditional approaches while avoiding word segmentation, which demonstrates its superiority in Asian language text classification.

    :abstractText: Options are important financial instruments, whose prices are usually determined by computational methods. Computational finance is a compelling application area for reinforcement learning research, where hard sequential decision making problems abound and have great practical significance. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning methods, in particular, least squares policy iteration (LSPI), for the problem of learning an exercise policy for American options. We also investigate a method by Tsitsiklis and Van Roy, referred to as FQI. We compare LSPI and FQI with LSM, the standard least squares Monte Carlo method from the finance community. We evaluate their performance on both real and synthetic data. The results show that the exercise policies discovered by LSPI and FQI gain larger payoffs than those discovered by LSM, on both real and synthetic data. Our work shows that solution methods developed in reinforcement learning can advance the state of the art in an important and challenging application area, and demonstrates furthermore that computational finance remains an under-explored area for deployment of reinforcement learning methods.

    :abstractText: Effective local search methods for finding satisfying assignments of CNF formulae exhibit several systematic characteristics in their search. We identify a series of measurable characteristics of local search behavior that are predictive of problem solving efficiency. These measures are shown to be useful for diagnosing inefficiencies in given search procedures, tuning parameters, and predicting the value of innovations to existing strategies. We then introduce a new local search method, SDF ("smoothed descent and flood"), that builds upon the intuitions gained by our study. SDF works by greedily descending in an informative objective (that considers how strongly clauses are satisfied, in addition to counting the number of unsatisfied clauses) and, once trapped in a local minima, "floods" this minima by re-weighting unsatisfied clauses to create a new descent direction. The resulting procedure exhibits superior local search characteristics under our measures. We show that this method can compete with the state of the art techniques, and significantly reduces the number of search steps relative to many recent methods. Copyright 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

    :abstractText: We augment naive Bayes models with statistical n-gram language models to address short-comings of the standard naive Bayes text classifier. The result is a generalized naive Bayes classifier which allows for a local Markov dependence among observations&semi; a model we refer to as the Chain Augmented Naive Bayes (CAN) Bayes classifier. CAN models have two advantages over standard naive Bayes classifiers. First, they relax some of the independence assumptions of naive Bayes&mdash;allowing a local Markov chain dependence in the observed variables&mdash;while still permitting efficient inference and learning. Second, they permit straightforward application of sophisticated smoothing techniques from statistical language modeling, which allows one to obtain better parameter estimates than the standard Laplace smoothing used in naive Bayes classification. In this paper, we introduce CAN models and apply them to various text classification problems. To demonstrate the language independent and task independent nature of these classifiers, we present experimental results on several text classification problems&mdash;authorship attribution, text genre classification, and topic detection&mdash;in several languages&mdash;Greek, English, Japanese and Chinese. We then systematically study the key factors in the CAN model that can influence the classification performance, and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

    :abstractText: We propose a self-supervised word segmentation technique for text segmentation in Chinese information retrieval. This method combines the advantages of traditional dictionary based, character based and mutual information based approaches, while overcoming many of their shortcomings. Experiments on TREC data show this method is promising. Our method is completely language independent and unsupervised, which provides a promising avenue for constructing accurate multi-lingual or cross-lingual information retrieval systems that are flexible and adaptive. We find that although the segmentation accuracy of self-supervised segmentation is not as high as some other segmentation methods, it is enough to give good retrieval performance. It is commonly believed that word segmentation accuracy is monotonically related to retrieval performance in Chinese information retrieval. However, for Chinese, we find that the relationship between segmentation and retrieval performance is in fact nonmonotonic&semi; that is, at around 70% word segmentation accuracy an over-segmentation phenomenon begins to occur which leads to a reduction in information retrieval performance. We demonstrate this effect by presenting an empirical investigation of information retrieval on Chinese TREC data, using a wide variety of word segmentation algorithms with word segmentation accuracies ranging from 44% to 95%, including 70% word segmentation accuracy from our self-supervised word-segmentation approach. It appears that the main reason for the drop in retrieval performance is that correct compounds and collocations are preserved by accurate segmenters, while they are broken up by less accurate (but reasonable) segmenters, to a surprising advantage. This suggests that words themselves might be too broad a notion to conveniently capture the general semantic meaning of Chinese text. Our research suggests machine learning techniques can play an important role in building adaptable information retrieval systems and different evaluation standards for word segmentation should be given to different applications.

    :abstractText: "We present a novel session identification method based on statistical language modeling. Unlike standard time-out methods, which use fixed time thresholds for session identification, we use an information theoretic approach that yields more robust results for identifying session boundaries. We evaluate our new approach by learning interesting association rules from the segmented session files. We then compare the performance of our approach to three standard session identification method--the standard timeout method, the reference length method, and the maximal forward reference method--and find that our statistical language modeling approach generally yields superior results. However, as with every method, the performance of our technique varies with changing parameter settings. Therefore, we also analyze the influence of the two key factors in our language-modeling-based approach: the choice of smoothing technique and the language model order. We find that all standard smoothing techniques, save one, perform well, and that performance is robust to language model order."

    :abstractText: The problem of learning linear-discriminant concepts can be solved by various mistake-driven update procedures, including the Winnow family of algorithms and the well-known Perceptron algorithm. In this paper we define the general class of &ldquo;quasi-additive&rdquo; algorithms, which includes Perceptron and Winnow as special cases. We give a single proof of convergence that covers a broad subset of algorithms in this class, including both Perceptron and Winnow, but also many new algorithms. Our proof hinges on analyzing a generic measure of progress construction that gives insight as to when and how such algorithms converge.Our measure of progress construction also permits us to obtain good mistake bounds for individual algorithms. We apply our unified analysis to new algorithms as well as existing algorithms. When applied to known algorithms, our method &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; produces close variants of existing proofs (recovering similar bounds)&mdash;thus showing that, in a certain sense, these seemingly diverse results are fundamentally isomorphic. However, we also demonstrate that the unifying principles are more broadly applicable, and analyze a new class of algorithms that smoothly interpolate between the additive-update behavior of Perceptron and the multiplicative-update behavior of Winnow.

    :abstractText: We present a general approach to model selection and regularization that exploits unlabeled data to adaptively control hypothesis complexity in supervised learning tasks. The idea is to impose a metric structure on hypotheses by determining the discrepancy between their predictions across the distribution of unlabeled data. We show how this metric can be used to detect untrustworthy training error estimates, and devise novel model selection strategies that exhibit theoretical guarantees against over-fitting (while still avoiding under-fitting). We then extend the approach to derive a general training criterion for supervised learning&mdash;yielding an adaptive regularization method that uses unlabeled data to automatically set regularization parameters. This new criterion adjusts its regularization level to the specific set of training data received, and performs well on a variety of regression and conditional density estimation tasks. The only proviso for these methods is that sufficient unlabeled training data be available.

    :abstractText: "We present a unified probabilistic framework for statistical language modeling which can simultaneously incorporate various aspects of natural language, such as local word interaction, syntactic structure and semantic document information. Our approach is based on a recent statistical inference principle we have proposed--the latent maximum entropy principle--which allows relationships over hidden features to be effectively captured in a unified model. Our work extends previous research on maximum entropy methods for language modeling, which only allow observed features to be modeled. The ability to conveniently incorporate hidden variables allows us to extend the expressiveness of language models while alleviating the necessity of pre-processing the data to obtain explicitly observed features. We describe efficient algorithms for marginalization, inference and normalization in our extended models. We then use these techniques to combine two standard forms of language models: local lexical models (Markov N-gram models) and global document-level semantic models (probabilistic latent semantic analysis). Our experimental results on the Wall Street Journal corpus show that we obtain a 18.5% reduction in perplexity compared to the baseline tri-gram model with Good-Turing smoothing."

    :abstractText: This paper proposes a generic criterion that defines the optimum number of basis functions for radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The generalization performance of an RBF network relates to its prediction capability on independent test data. This performance gives a measure of the quality of the chosen model. An RBF network with an overly restricted basis gives poor predictions on new data, since the model has too little flexibility (yielding high bias and low variance). By contrast, an RBF network with too many basis functions also gives poor generalization performance since it is too flexible and fits too much of the noise on the training data (yielding low bias but high variance). Bias and variance are complementary quantities, and it is necessary to assign the number of basis function optimally in order to achieve the best compromise between them. In this paper we use Stein's unbiased risk estimator to derive an analytical criterion for assigning the appropriate number of basis functions. Two cases of known and unknown noise have been considered and the efficacy of this criterion in both situations is illustrated experimentally. The paper also shows an empirical comparison between this method and two well known classical methods, cross validation and the Bayesian information criterion, BIC.

    :abstractText: This paper describes a novel solution to the rigid point pattern matching problem in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. Although we assume rigid motion, jitter is allowed. We present a noniterative, polynomial time algorithm that is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for the noiseless case. First, we model point pattern matching as a weighted graph matching problem, where weights correspond to Euclidean distances between nodes. We then formulate graph matching as a problem of finding a maximum probability configuration in a graphical model. By using graph rigidity arguments, we prove that a sparse graphical model yields equivalent results to the fully connected model in the noiseless case. This allows us to obtain an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and is provably optimal for exact matching between noiseless point sets. For inexact matching, we can still apply the same algorithm to find approximately optimal solutions. Experimental results obtained by our approach show improvements in accuracy over current methods, particularly when matching patterns of different sizes.

    :abstractText: "Training principles for unsupervised learning are often derived from motivations that appear to be independent of supervised learning. In this paper we present a simple unification of several supervised and unsupervised training principles through the concept of optimal reverse prediction: predict the inputs from the target labels, optimizing both over model parameters and any missing labels. In particular, we show how supervised least squares, principal components analysis, k-means clustering and normalized graph-cut can all be expressed as instances of the same training principle. Natural forms of semi-supervised regression and classification are then automatically derived, yielding semi-supervised learning algorithms for regression and classification that, surprisingly, are novel and refine the state of the art. These algorithms can all be combined with standard regularizers and made non-linear via kernels."

    :abstractText: Discovering groups of genes that share common expression profiles is an important problem in DNA microarray analysis. Unfortunately, standard bi-clustering algorithms often fail to retrieve common expression groups because (1) genes only exhibit similar behaviors over a subset of conditions, and (2) genes may participate in more than one functional process and therefore belong to multiple groups. Many algorithms have been proposed to address these problems in the past decade; however, in addition to the above challenges most such algorithms are unable to discover linear coherent bi-clusters--a strict generalization of additive and multiplicative bi-clustering models. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-clustering algorithm that discovers linear coherent bi-clusters, based on first detecting linear correlations between pairs of gene expression profiles, then identifying groups by sample majority voting. Our experimental results on both synthetic and two real datasets, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana, show significant performance improvements over previous methods. One intriguing aspect of our approach is that it can easily be extended to identify bi-clusters of more complex gene-gene correlations.

    :abstractText: We present a generalized view of support vector machines that does not rely on a Euclidean geometric interpretation nor even positive semidefinite kernels. We base our development instead on the confidence matrix--the matrix normally determined by the direct (Hadamard) product of the kernel matrix with the label outer-product matrix. It turns out that alternative forms of confidence matrices are possible, and indeed useful. By focusing on the confidence matrix instead of the underlying kernel, we can derive an intuitive principle for optimizing example weights to yield robust classifiers. Our principle initially recovers the standard quadratic SVM training criterion, which is only convex for kernel-derived confidence measures. However, given our generalized view, we are then able to derive a principled relaxation of the SVM criterion that yields a convex upper bound. This relaxation is always convex and can be solved with a linear program. Our new training procedure obtains similar generalization performance to standard SVMs on kernel-derived confidence functions, but achieves even better results with indefinite confidence functions.

    :abstractText: Future CMP designs that will integrate tens of processor cores on-chip will be constrained by area and power. Area constraints make impractical the use of a bus or a crossbar as the on-chip interconnection network, and tiled CMPs organized around a direct interconnection network will probably be the architecture of choice. Power constraints make impractical to rely on broadcasts (as Token-CMP does) or any other brute-force method for keeping cache coherence, and directory-based cache coherence protocols are currently being employed. Unfortunately, directory protocols introduce indirection to access directory information, which negatively impacts performance. In this work, we present DiCo-CMP, a novel cache coherence protocol especially suited to future tiled CMP architectures. In DiCo- CMP the role of storing up-to-date sharing information and ensuring totally ordered accesses for every memory block is assigned to the cache that must provide the block on a miss. Therefore, DiCo-CMP reduces the miss latency compared to a directory protocol by sending coherence messages directly from the requesting caches to those that must observe them (as it would be done in brute-force protocols), and reduces the network traffic compared to Token-CMP (and consequently, power consumption in the interconnection network) by sending just one request message for each miss. Using an extended version of GEMS simulator we show that DiCo-CMP achieves improvements in execution time of up to 8% on average over a directory protocol, and reductions in terms of network traffic of up to 42% on average compared to Token-CMP.

    :abstractText: "Categorizing multiple objects in images is essentially a structured prediction problem: the label of an object is in general dependent on the labels of other objects in the image. We explicitly model object dependencies in a sparse graphical topology induced by the adjacency of objects in the image, which benefits inference, and then use maximum margin principle to learn the model discriminatively. Moreover, we propose a novel exact inference method, which is used in training to find the most violated constraint required by cutting plane method. A slightly modified inference method is used in testing when the target labels are unseen. Experiment results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the improvement of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

    :abstractText: We explore the problem of sharing network resources when agents' preferences lead to temporally concentrated, inefficient use of the network. In such cases, external incentives must be supplied to smooth out demand. Taking a game-theoretic approach, we consider a setting in which bandwidth is available during several time slots at a fixed cost, but all agents have a natural preference for choosing the same slot. We present four mechanisms that motivate agents to distribute load optimally by probabilistically waiving the cost for each time slot, and analyze equilibria.

    :abstractText: The Secure and robust Critical Information-Technology Infrastructure (S-CITI for short) project aims at providing support to Emergency Managers (EMs) that are faced with management of resources and with decisions before, during, and after emergencies or disasters. Our approach consists of using new and existing sensors to gather data from the field, processing this data to detect and predict emergency/disaster situations, and disseminating this data among the appropriate organizational units. The data flow will be done in a reliable and secure manner and EMs will coordinate actions in a Virtual Coordination Center (VCC), which need not be in a fixed (and thus vulnerable) physical location. The EMs are responsible for indicating what type of data is more valuable, so that S-CITI can display that information appropriately.

To overcome this limitation the state-of-the-art information retrieval approaches rely on the latent semantic analysis in which terms in articles are projected to a lower dimensional latent space and best possible matches in this space are identified. However, this approach may not perform well enough if the number of explicit knowledge entities in the articles is too small compared to the amount of knowledge in the domain. We address the problem by exploiting a domain knowledge layer, a rich network of relations among knowledge entities in the domain extracted from a large corpus of documents. The knowledge layer supplies the context knowledge that lets us relate different knowledge entities and hence improve the information retrieval performance. We develop and study a new framework for i) learning and aggregating the relations in the knowledge layer from the literature corpus; ii) and for exploiting these relations to improve the information-retrieval of relevant documents.

    :abstractText: "Motivation: The \xE2\x80\x98reproducibility\xE2\x80\x99 of mass spectrometry proteomic profiling has become an intensely controversial topic. The mere mention of concern over the \xE2\x80\x98reproducibility\xE2\x80\x99 of data generated from any particular platform can lead to the anxiety over the generalizability of its results and its role in the future of discovery proteomics. In this study, we examine the reproducibility of proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) across multiple data-generation sessions. We analyze the problem in terms of the reproducibility of signals, reproducibility of discriminative features and reproducibility of multivariate classification models on profiles for serum samples from early lung cancer and healthy control subjects. Results: Proteomic profiles in individual data-generation sessions experience within-session variability. We show that combining data from multiple sessions introduces additional (inter-session) noise. While additional noise can affect the discriminative analysis, we show that its average effect on profiles in our study is relatively small. Moreover, for the purposes of prediction on future (previously unseen) data, classifiers trained on multi-session data are able to adapt to inter-session noise and improve their classification accuracy.

    :abstractText: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide an elegant mathematical framework for modeling complex decision and planning problems in stochastic domains in which states of the system are observable only indirectly, via a set of imperfect or noisy observations. The modeling advantage of POMDPs, however, comes at a price -- exact methods for solving them are computationally very expensive and thus applicable in practice only to very simple problems. We focus on efficient approximation (heuristic) methods that attempt to alleviate the computational problem and trade off accuracy for speed. We have two objectives here. First, we survey various approximation methods, analyze their properties and relations and provide some new insights into their differences. Second, we present a number of new approximation methods and novel refinements of existing techniques. The theoretical results are supported by experiments on a problem from the agent navigation domain.

    :abstractText: The increasing availability of digital documents in the last decade has prompted the development of machine learning techniques to automatically classify and organize text documents. The majority of text classification systems rely on the vector space model, which represents the documents as vectors in the term space. Each vector component is assigned a weight that reflects the importance of the term in the document. Typically, these weights are assigned using an information retrieval (IR) approach, such as the famous tf-idf function. In this work, we study two weighting schemes based on information gain and chi-square statistics. These schemes take advantage of the category label information to weight the terms according to their distributions across the different categories. We show that using these supervised weights instead of conventional unsupervised weights can greatly improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. Experimental evaluations, carried out on multiple text classification tasks, demonstrate the benefits of this approach in creating accurate text classifiers.

    :abstractText: Whole-sample mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics allows for a parallel measurement of hundreds of proteins present in a variety of biospecimens. Unfortunately, the association between MS signals and these proteins is not straightforward. The need to interpret mass spectra demands the development of methods for accurate labeling of ion species in such profiles. To aid this process, we have developed a new peak-labeling procedure for associating protein and peptide labels with peaks. This computational method builds upon characteristics of proteins expected to be in the sample, such as the amino sequence, mass weight, and expected concentration within the sample. A new probabilistic score that incorporates this information is proposed. We evaluate and demonstrate our method's ability to label peaks first on simulated MS spectra and then on MS spectra from human serum with a spiked-in calibration mixture.

    :abstractText: In this paper, an efficient rate-control scheme for H.264/AVC video encoding is proposed. The redesign of the quantization scheme in H.264/AVC results in that the relationship between the quantization parameter and the true quantization stepsize is no longer linear. Based on this observation, we propose a new rate-distortion (R-D) model by utilizing the true quantization stepsize and then develop an improved rate-control scheme for the H.264/AVC encoder based on this new R-D model. In general, the current R-D optimization (RDO) mode-selection scheme in H.264/AVC test model is difficult for rate control, because rate control usually requires a predetermined set of motion vectors and coding modes to select the quantization parameter, whereas the RDO does in the different order and requires a predetermined quantization parameter to select motion vectors and coding modes. To tackle this problem, we develop a complexity-adjustable rate-control scheme based on the proposed R-D model. Briefly, the proposed scheme is a one-pass process at frame level and a partial two-pass process at macroblock level. Since the number of macroblocks with the two-pass processing can be controlled by an encoder parameter, the fully one-pass implementation is a subset of the proposed algorithm. An additional topic discussed in this paper is about video buffering. Since a hypothetical reference decoder (HRD) has been defined in H.264/AVC to guarantee that the buffers never overflow or underflow, the more accurate rate-allocation schemes are proposed to satisfy these requirements of HRD.

    :abstractText: The increased availability of time series datasets prompts the development of new tools and methods that allow machine learning classifiers to better cope with time series data. Time series data are usually characterized by a high space dimensionality and a very strong correlation among features. This special nature makes the development of effective time series classifiers a challenging task. This work proposes and analyzes methods combining spectral decomposition and feature selection for time series classification problems and compares them against methods that work with original time series and time-dependent features. Briefly, our approach first applies discrete cosine transform (DCT) or discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on time series data. Then, it performs supervised feature selection/reduction by selecting only the most discriminative set of coefficients to represent the data. Experimental evaluations, carried out on multiple datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our approach in learning efficient and accurate time series classifiers.

This proposed metric lets us measure the mutual relevancy in between terms and between their groups. This paper shows how to define this metric automatically from the document collection, and then apply it in query expansion for document retrieval tasks. The experiments show this method can be used to find good expansion terms of search queries and improve document retrieval performance on two TREC genomic track datasets.

    :abstractText: The prismatic cube style of modular robot is a promising design for realizing self-reconfigurable 3D lattices. Cubic lattices with prismatic transitions simplify many aspects of the hardware and planning control needed for reconfiguration. Despite much research on how cubic modules can coordinate to reconfigure, until now these transitions have not been fully demonstrated in hardware.We describe our movement primitives for both orthogonal and convex corner transitions with prismatic cube modules. We discuss the design of a hardware module capable of performing these transitions, as well as assess the performance of this hardware in an initial demonstration of these transitions.

    :abstractText: In recent years, there has been a rapid and wide spread of non-traditional computing platforms, especially mobile and portable computing devices. As applications become increasingly sophisticated and processing power increases, the most serious limitation on these devices is the available battery life. Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) has been a key technique in exploiting the hardware characteristics of processors to reduce energy dissipation by lowering the supply voltage and operating frequency. The DVS algorithms are shown to be able to make dramatic energy savings while providing the necessary peak computation power in general-purpose systems. However, for a large class of applications in embedded real-time systems like cellular phones and camcorders, the variable operating frequency interferes with their deadline guarantee mechanisms, and DVS in this context, despite its growing importance, is largely overlooked/under-developed. To provide real-time guarantees, DVS must consider deadlines and periodicity of real-time tasks, requiring integration with the real-time scheduler. In this paper, we present a class of novel algorithms called real-time DVS (RT-DVS) that modify the OS's real-time scheduler and task management service to provide significant energy savings while maintaining real-time deadline guarantees. We show through simulations and a working prototype implementation that these RT-DVS algorithms closely approach the theoretical lower bound on energy consumption, and can easily reduce energy consumption 20% to 40% in an embedded real-time system.

    :abstractText: EMERALDS (Extensible Microkernel for Embedded, ReAL-time, Distributed Systems) is a real-time microkernel designed for small-memory embedded applications. These applications must run on slow (15-25MHz) processors with just 32-128 kbytes of memory, either to keep production costs down in mass-produced systems or to keep weight and power consumption low. To be feasible for such applications, the OS must not only be small in size (less than 20 kbytes), but also have low-overhead kernel services. Unlike commercial embedded OSs which rely on carefully-crafted code to achieve efficiency, EMERALDS takes the approach of re-designing the basic OS services of task scheduling, synchronization, communication, and system call mechanism by using characteristics found in small-memory embedded systems, such as small code size and a priori knowledge of task execution and communication patterns. With these new schemes, the overheads of various OS services are reduced 20-40% without compromising any OS functionality.

    :abstractText: Despite constant improvements in fabrication technology, hardware components are consuming more power than ever. With the ever-increasing demand for higher performance in highly-integrated systems, and as battery technology falls further behind, managing energy is becoming critically important to various embedded and mobile systems. In this paper, we propose and implement power-aware virtual memory to reduce the energy consumed by the memory in response to workloads becoming increasingly data-centric. We can use the power management features in current memory technology to put individual memory devices into low power modes dynamically under software control to reduce the power dissipation. However, it is imperative that any techniques employed weigh memory energy savings against any potential energy increases in other system components due to performance degradation of the memory. Using a novel power-aware virtual memory implementation, we estimate a significant reduction in memory power dissipation, from 4.1 W to 0.5-2.7 W, based on Rambus memory specifications, while running various real-world applications in a working Linux system. Unfortunately, due to a hardware bug in the chipset, direct power measurement is currently not possible. Applying more advanced techniques, we can reduce power dissipation further to 0.2-1.7 W, depending on the actual workload, with negligible effects on performance. We also show this work is applicable to other memory architectures, and is orthogonal to previously-proposed hardware-controlled power-management techniques, so it can be applied simultaneously to further enhance energy conservation in a variety of platforms.

    :abstractText: There is an increasing prevalence of interactive Web sessions in the Internet. These are mostly short-lived TCP connections that are delay-sensitive and have transfer times dominated by TCP backoffs, if any, during connection establishment. Unfortunately, arrivals of such connections at a server tend to be bursty, and can trigger multiple retransmissions, resulting in long average client-perceived delays. Traditional traffic control mechanisms, such as token bucket filters, are designed to complement admission control mechanisms, by regulating throughput, bounding service times, and protecting systems from overload. However, they cannot control connection-establishment delays, and thus, do not provide effective control of client-perceived delays. We first present the surprising discovery of a resynchronization property of retransmitted requests that exacerbates client-perceived delays when traditional control mechanisms are used. Then, we introduce a novel, multistage filtering scheme called Abacus Filters (AFs) that limits the client-perceived delay while maximizing server throughput even in the case of bursty connection arrivals. Analysis of delay-control properties of various filtering mechanisms is presented, along with a detailed performance evaluation. AFs are shown to provide tight delay control and better complement traditional admission control policies.

    :abstractText: Given 3D scanned anthropological models and the physical parameters of a microwave imaging system, we develop a virtual human surface imagery system with a finite multi-physics surface model. The concealed object detection algorithms are developed based on the wave intensity and surface characteristics. The virtual human image system can be integrated into a systematic design process, enabling multidisciplinary innovations in security, privacy, healthcare, computer vision, and information visualization. This forward-thinking approach intends to transform the development of human imaging technologies from being device-specific and proprietary to being device-independent and open source-oriented. It also transforms the research into a systematic design process, enabling multidisciplinary innovations in digital human modeling, computer vision, information visualization, and computational aesthetics. This study can help to design privacy-aware imaging systems in airports and medical systems.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a new technique, compiler-directed page coloring, that eliminates conflict misses in multiprocessor applications. It enables applications to make better use of the increased aggregate cache size available in a multiprocessor. This technique uses the compiler's knowledge of the access patterns of the parallelized applications to direct the operating system's virtual memory page mapping strategy. We demonstrate that this technique can lead to significant performance improvements over two commonly used page mapping strategies for machines with either direct-mapped or two-way set-associative caches. We also show that it is complementary to latency-hiding techniques such as prefetching.We implemented compiler-directed page coloring in the SUIF parallelizing compiler and on two commercial operating systems. We applied the technique to the SPEC95fp benchmark suite, a representative set of numeric programs. We used the SimOS machine simulator to analyze the applications and isolate their performance bottlenecks. We also validated these results on a real machine, an eight-processor 350MHz Digital AlphaServer. Compiler-directed page coloring leads to significant performance improvements for several applications. Overall, our technique improves the SPEC95fp rating for eight processors by 8% over Digital UNIX's page mapping policy and by 20% over a page coloring, a standard page mapping policy. The SUIF compiler achieves a SPEC95fp ratio of 57.4, the highest ratio to date.

    :abstractText: Software-controlled data prefetching offers the potential for bridging the ever-increasing speed gap between the memory subsystem and today's high-performance processors. While prefetching has enjoyed considerable success in array-based numeric codes, its potential in pointer-based applications has remained largely unexplored. This paper investigates compiler-based prefetching for pointer-based applications---in particular, those containing recursive data structures. We identify the fundamental problem in prefetching pointer-based data structures and propose a guideline for devising successful prefetching schemes. Based on this guideline, we design three prefetching schemes, we automate the most widely applicable scheme (greedy prefetching) in an optimizing research compiler, and we evaluate the performance of all three schemes on a modern superscalar processor similar to the MIPS R10000. Our results demonstrate that compiler-inserted prefetching can significantly improve the execution speed of pointer-based codes---as much as 45% for the applications we study. In addition, the more sophisticated algorithms (which we currently perform by hand, but which might be implemented in future compilers) can improve performance by as much as twofold. Compared with the only other compiler-based pointer prefetching scheme in the literature, our algorithms offer substantially better performance by avoiding unnecessary overhead and hiding more latency.

    :abstractText: While there have been many recent proposals for hardware that supports Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), there has been relatively little work on compiler optimizations to fully exploit this potential for parallelizing programs optimistically. In this paper, we focus on one important limitation of program performance under TLS, which is stalls due to forwarding scalar values between threads that would otherwise cause frequent data dependences. We present and evaluate dataflow algorithms for three increasingly-aggressive instruction scheduling techniques that reduce the critical forwarding path introduced by the synchronization associated with this data forwarding. In addition, we contrast our compiler techniques with related hardware-only approaches. With our most aggressive compiler and hardware techniques, we improve performance under TLS by 6.2-28.5% for 6 of 14 applications, and by at least 2.7% for half of the other applications.

    :abstractText: Runtime monitoring tools are invaluable for detecting various types of bugs, in both sequential and multi-threaded programs. However, these tools often slow down the monitored program by an order of magnitude or more [4], implying that the tools are ill-suited for always-on monitoring of deployed code. Fortunately, the emergence of chip multiprocessors as a dominant computing platform means that resources are available on-chip to assist in monitoring tasks. In this brief note, we advocate Log-Based Architectures (LBA) that exploit such on-chip resources in order to dramatically reduce the overhead of runtime program monitoring. Specifically, we propose adding hardware support for logging a main program's trace and delivering it to another (otherwise idle) processing core for inspection. A life-guard program running on this other core executes the desired monitoring task.

    :abstractText: Efficient inter-thread value communication is essential for improving performance in Thread-Level Speculation (TLS). Although several mechanisms for improving value communication using hardware support have been proposed, there is relatively little work onexploiting the potential of compiler optimization.Building on recent research on compiler optimization of scalar value communication between speculative threads, we propose compiler techniques for the optimization of memory-resident values.In TLS, data dependences through memory-resident values aretracked by the underlying hardware and preserved by reexecutingany speculative thread that violates a dependence; however, reexecution incurs a large performance penalty and should be usedonly to resolve data dependences that are infrequent. In contrast,value communication for frequently-occurring data dependencesmust be very efficient.In this paper, we propose using the compiler to first identifyfrequently-occurring memory-resident data dependences, then insert synchronization for communicating values to preserve thesedependences. We find that by synchronizing frequently-occurringdata dependences we can significantly improve the efficiency ofparallel execution. A comparison between compiler-inserted andhardware-inserted memory synchronization reveals that the two techniques are complementary, with each technique benefitting different benchmarks.

    :abstractText: "Thread-Level Speculation (TLS) allows us to automatically parallelize general-purpose programs by supporting parallel execution of threads that might not actually be independent. In this paper, we show that the key to good performance lies in the three different ways to communicate a value between speculative threads: speculation, synchronization, and prediction. The difficult part is deciding how and when to apply each method.This paper shows how we can apply value prediction, dynamic synchronization, and hardware instruction prioritization to improve value communication and hence performance in several SPECint benchmarks that have been automatically-transformed by our compiler to exploit TLS. We find that value prediction can be effective when properly throttled to avoid the high costs of misprediction, while most of the gains of value prediction can be more easily achieved by exploiting silent stores. We also show that dynamic synchronization is quite effective for most benchmarks, while hardware instruction prioritization is not. Overall, we find that these techniques have great potential for improving the performance of TLS."

    :abstractText: Hash join algorithms suffer from extensive CPU cachestalls. This paper shows that the standard hash join algorithm for disk-oriented databases (i.e. GRACE) spends over73% of its user time stalled on CPU cache misses, and explores the use of prefetching to improve its cache performance. Applying prefetching to hash joins is complicatedby the data dependencies, multiple code paths, and inherent randomness of hashing. We present two techniques, group prefetching and software-pipelined prefetching, thatovercome these complications.These schemes achieve 2.0- 2.9X speedups for the join phase and 1.4-2.6X speedups forthe partition phase over GRACE and simple prefetching approaches. Compared with previous cache-aware approaches(i.e. cache partitioning), the schemes are at least 50% fasteron large relations and do not require exclusive use of theCPU cache to be effective.

    :abstractText: A promising approach to scaling Web applications is to distribute the server infrastructure on which they run. This approach, unfortunately, can introduce latency between the application and database servers, which in turn increases the network latency of Web interactions for the clients (end users). In this paper we introduce the concept of source-to-source holistic transformations---transformations that seek to optimize both the application code and the database requests made by it, to reduce clientlatency. As examples of our concept, we propose and evaluate two source-to-source holistic transformations that focus on hiding the latencies of database queries. We argue that opportunities for applying these transformations will continue to exist in Web applications. We then present algorithms for automating these transformations in asource-to-source compiler. Finally, we evaluate the effect of these two transformations on three realistic Web benchmark applications, both in the traditional centralized setting and a distributed setting.

    :abstractText: "Thread-level speculation (TLS) has proven to be a promising method of extracting parallelism from both integer and scientific workloads, targeting speculative threads that range in size from hundreds to several thousand dynamic instructions and have minimal dependences between them. Recent work has shown that TLS can offer compelling performance improvements for database workloads, but only when targeting much larger speculative threads of more than 50,000 dynamic instructions per thread, with many frequent data dependences between them. To support such large and dependent speculative threads, hardware must be able to buffer the additional speculative state, and must also address the more challenging problem of tolerating the resulting cross-thread data dependences In this paper we present hardware support for large speculative threads that integrates several previous proposals for TLS hardware. We also introduce support for subthreads: a mechanism for tolerating cross-thread data dependences by checkpointing speculative execution. When speculation fails due to a violated data dependence, with sub-threads the failed thread need only rewind to the checkpoint of the appropriate sub-thread rather than rewinding to the start of execution; this significantly reduces the cost of mis-speculation. We evaluate our hardware support for large and dependent speculative threads in the database domain and find that the transaction response time for three of the five transactions from TPC-C (on a simulated 4- processor chip-multiprocessor) speedup by a factor of 1.9 to 2.9."

    :abstractText: Memory latency is an important bottleneck in system performance that cannot be adequately solved by hardware alone. Several promising software techniques have been shown to address this problem successfully in specific situations. However, the generality of these software approaches has been limited because current architectures do not provide a fine-grained, low-overhead mechanism for observing and reacting to memory behavior directly. To fill this need, we propose a new class of memory operations called informing memory operations, which essentially consist of a memory operation combined (either implicitly or explicitly) with a conditional branch-and-link operation that is taken only if the reference suffers a cache miss. We describe two different implementations of informing memory operations---one based on a cache-outcome condition code and another based on low-overhead traps---and find that modern in-order-issue and out-of-order-issue superscalar processors already contain the bulk of the necessary hardware support. We describe how a number of software-based memory optimizations can exploit informing memory operations to enhance performance, and look at cache coherence with fine-grained access control as a case study. Our performance results demonstrate that the runtime overhead of invoking the informing mechanism on the Alpha 21164 and MIPS R10000 processors is generally small enough to provide considerable flexibility to hardware and software designers, and that the cache coherence application has improved performance compared to other current solutions. We believe that the inclusion of informing memory operations in future processors may spur even more innovative performance optimizations.

    :abstractText: By optimizing data layout at run-time, we can potentially enhance the performance of caches by actively creating spatial locality, facilitating prefetching, and avoiding cache conflicts and false sharing. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to guarantee that such optimizations are safe in practice on today's machines, since accurately updating all pointers to an object requires perfect alias information, which is well beyond the scope of the compiler for languages such as C. To overcome this limitation, we propose a technique called memory forwarding which effectively adds a new layer of indirection within the memory system whenever necessary to guarantee that data relocation is always safe. Because actual forwarding rarely occurs (it exists as a safety net), the mechanism can be implemented as an exception in modern superscalar processors. Our experimental results demonstrate that the aggressive layout optimizations enabled by memory forwarding can result in significant speedups---more than twofold in some cases---by reducing the number of cache misses, improving the effectiveness of prefetching, and conserving memory bandwidth.

    :abstractText: While architects understand how to build cost-effective parallel machines across a wide spectrum of machine sizes (ranging from within a single chip to large-scale servers), the real challenge is how to easily create parallel software to effectively exploit all of this raw performance potential. One promising technique for overcoming this problem is Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), which enables the compiler to optimistically create parallel threads despite uncertainty as to whether those threads are actually independent. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a design for supporting TLS that seamlessly scales to any machine size because it is a straightforward extension of writeback invalidation-based cache coherence (which itself scales both up and down). Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme performs well on both single-chip multiprocessors and on larger-scale machines where communication latencies are twenty times larger.

    :abstractText: "Instruction-grain program monitoring tools, which check and analyze executing programs at the granularity of individual instructions, are invaluable for quickly detecting bugs and security attacks and then limiting their damage (via containment and/or recovery). Unfortunately, their fine-grain nature implies very high monitoring overheads for software-only tools, which are typically based on dynamic binary instrumentation. Previous hardware proposals either focus on mechanisms that target specific bugs or address only the cost of binary instrumentation. In this paper, we propose a flexible hardware solution for accelerating a wide range of instruction-grain monitoring tools. By examining a number of diverse tools (for memory checking, security tracking, and data race detection), we identify three significant common sources of overheads and then propose three novel hardware techniques for addressing these overheads: Inheritance Tracking, Idempotent Filters, and Metadata-TLBs. Together, these constitute a general-purpose hardware acceleration framework. Experimental results show our framework reduces overheads by 2-3X over the previous state-of-the-art, while supporting the needed flexibility."

    :abstractText: To maximize the benefit and minimize the overhead of software-based latency tolerance techniques, we would like to apply them precisely to the set of dynamic references that suffer cache misses. Unfortunately, the information provided by the state-of-the-art cache miss profiling technique (summary profiling) is inadequate for references with intermediate miss ratios - it results in either failing to hide latency, or else inserting unnecessary overhead. To overcome this problem, we propose and evaluate a new technique - correlation profiling - which improves predictability by correlating the caching behavior with the associated dynamic context. Our experimental results demonstrate that roughly half of the 22 non-numeric applications we study can potentially enjoy significant reductions in memory stall time by exploiting at least one of the three forms of correlation profiling we consider.

    :abstractText: Out-of-core applications consume physical resources at a rapid rate, causing interactive applications sharing the same machine to exhibit poor response times. This behavior is the result of default resource management strategies in the OS that are inappropriate for memory-intensive applications. Using an approach that integrates compiler analysis with simple OS support and a run-time layer that adapts to dynamic conditions, we have shown that the impact of out-of-core applications on interactive ones can be greatly mitigated. A combination of prefetching pages that will soon be needed, and releasing pages no longer in use results in good throughput for the out-of-core task and good response time for the interactive one. Each class of application performs well according to the metric most important to it. In addition, the OS does not need to attempt to identify these application classes, or modify its default resource management policies in any way. We also observe that when an out-of-core application releases pages, it both improves the response time of interactive tasks, and also improves its own performance through better replacement decisions and reduced memory management overhead.

    :abstractText: "This paper proposes and evaluate Prefetching B+-Trees (pB+-Trees), which use prefetching to accelerate two important operations on B+-Tree indices: searches and range scans. To accelerate searches, pB+-Trees use prefetching to effectively create wider nodes than the natural data transfer size: e.g., eight vs. one cache lines or disk pages. These wider nodes reduce the height of the B+-Tree, thereby decreasing the number of expensive misses when going from parent to child without significantly increasing the cost of fetching a given node. Our results show that this technique speeds up search and update times by a factor of 1.21-1.5 for main-memory B+-Trees. In addition, it outperforms and is complementary to &ldquo;Cache-Sensitive B+-Trees.&rdquo; To accelerate range scans, pB+-Trees provide arrays of pointers to their leaf nodes. These allow the pB+-Tree to prefetch arbitrarily far ahead, even for nonclustered indices, thereby hiding the normally expensive cache misses associated with traversing the leaves within the range. Our results show that this technique yields over a sixfold speedup on range scans of 1000+ keys. Although our experimental evaluation focuses on main memory databases, the techniques that we propose are also applicable to hiding disk latency."

    :abstractText: "For Web applications in which the database component is the bottleneck, scalability can be provided by a third-party Database Scalability Service Provider (DSSP) that caches application data and supplies query answers on behalf of the application. Cost-effective DSSPs will need to cache data from many applications, inevitably raising concerns about security. However, if all data passing through a DSSP is encrypted to enhance security, then data updates trigger invalidation of large regions of cache. Consequently, achieving good scalability becomes virtually impossible. There is a tradeoff between security and scalability, which requires careful consideration.In this paper we study the security-scalability tradeoff, both formally and empirically. We begin by providing a method for statically identifying segments of the database that can be encrypted without impacting scalability. Experiments over a prototype DSSP system show the effectiveness of our static analysis method--for all three realistic bench-mark applications that we study, our method enables a significant fraction of the database to be encrypted without impacting scalability. Moreover, most of the data that can be encrypted without impacting scalability is of the type that application designers will want to encrypt, all other things being equal. Based on our static analysis method, we propose a new scalability-conscious security design methodology that features: (a) compulsory encryption of highly sensitive data like credit card information, and (b) encryption of data for which encryption does not impair scalability. As a result, the security-scalability tradeoff needs to be considered only over data for which encryption impacts scalability, thus greatly simplifying the task of managing the tradeoff."

    :abstractText: "In chip multiprocessors (CMPs), limiting the number of off-chip cache misses is crucial for good performance. Many multithreaded programs provide opportunities for constructive cache sharing, in which concurrently scheduled threads share a largely overlapping working set. In this brief announcement, we highlight our ongoing study [4] comparing the performance of two schedulers designed for fine-grained multithreaded programs: Parallel Depth First (PDF) [2], which is designed for constructive sharing, and Work Stealing (WS) [3], which takes a more traditional approach.Overview of schedulers. In PDF, processing cores are allocated ready-to-execute program tasks such that higher scheduling priority is given to those tasks the sequential program would have executed earlier. As a result, PDF tends to co-schedule threads in a way that tracks the sequential execution. Hence, the aggregate working set is (provably) not much larger than the single thread working set [1]. In WS, each processing core maintains a local work queue of readyto-execute threads. Whenever its local queue is empty, the core steals a thread from the bottom of the first non-empty queue it finds. WS is an attractive scheduling policy because when there is plenty of parallelism, stealing is quite rare. However, WS is not designed for constructive cache sharing, because the cores tend to have disjoint working sets.CMP configurations studied. We evaluated the performance of PDF and WS across a range of simulated CMP configurations. We focused on designs that have fixed-size private L1 caches and a shared L2 cache on chip. For a fixed die size (240 mm2), we varied the number of cores from 1 to 32. For a given number of cores, we used a (default) configuration based on current CMPs and realistic projections of future CMPs, as process technologies decrease from 90nm to 32nm.Summary of findings. We studied a variety of benchmark programs to show the following findings.For several application classes, PDF enables significant constructive sharing between threads, leading to better utilization of the on-chip caches and reducing off-chip traffic compared to WS. In particular, bandwidth-limited irregular programs and parallel divide-and-conquer programs present a relative speedup of 1.3-1.6X over WS, observing a 13- 41% reduction in off-chip traffic. An example is shown in Figure 1, for parallel merge sort. For each schedule, the number of L2 misses (i.e., the off-chip traffic) is shown on the left and the speed-up over running on one core is shown on the right, for 1 to 32 cores. Note that reducing the offchip traffic has the additional benefit of reducing the power consumption. Moreover, PDF's smaller working sets provide opportunities to power down segments of the cache without increasing the running time. Furthermore, when multiple programs are active concurrently, the PDF version is also less of a cache hog and its smaller working set is more likely to remain in the cache across context switches.For several other applications classes, PDF and WS have roughly the same execution times, either because there is only limited data reuse that can be exploited or because the programs are not limited by off-chip bandwidth. In the latter case, the constructive sharing PDF enables does provide the power and multiprogramming benefits discussed above.Finally, most parallel benchmarks to date, written for SMPs, use such a coarse-grained threading that they cannot exploit the constructive cache behavior inherent in PDF.We find that mechanisms to finely grain multithreaded applications are crucial to achieving good performance on CMPs."

Our experimental results indicate that PDF scheduling yields a 1.3--1.6X performance improvement relative to WS for several fine-grain parallel benchmarks on projected future CMP configurations; we also report several issues that may limit the advantage of PDF in certain applications. These results also indicate that PDF more effectively utilizes off-chip bandwidth, making it possible to trade-off on-chip cache for a larger number of cores. Moreover, we find that task granularity plays a key role in cache performance. Therefore, we present an automatic approach for selecting effective grain sizes, based on a new working set profiling algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches. This is the first paper demonstrating the effectiveness of PDF on real benchmarks, providing a direct comparison between PDF and WS, revealing the limiting factors for PDF in practice, and presenting an approach for overcoming these factors."

    :abstractText: Dynamic information flow tracking (DIFT) is an important tool for detecting common security attacks and memory bugs. A DIFT tool tracks the flow of information through a monitored program's registers and memory locations as the program executes, detecting and containing/fixing problems on-the-fly. Unfortunately, sequential DIFT tools are quite slow, and DIFT is quite challenging to parallelize. In this paper, we present a new approach to parallelizing DIFT-like functionality. Extending our recent work on accelerating sequential DIFT, we consider a variant of DIFT that tracks the information flow only through unary operations relaxed DIFT, and yet makes sense for detecting security attacks and memory bugs. We present a parallel algorithm for relaxed DIFT, based on symbolic inheritance tracking, which achieves linear speed-up asymptotically. Moreover, we describe techniques for reducing the constant factors, so that speed-ups can be obtained even with just a few processors. We implemented the algorithm in the context of a Log-Based Architectures (LBA) system, which provides hardware support for logging a program trace and delivering it to other (monitoring) processors. Our simulation results on SPEC benchmarks and a video player show that our parallel relaxed DIFT reduces the overhead to as low as 1.2X using 9 monitoring cores on a 16-core chip multiprocessor.

    :abstractText: "The key idea behind Inspector Joins is that during the I/O partitioning phase of a hash-based join, we have the opportunity to look at the actual data itself and then use this knowledge in two ways: (1) to create specialized indexes, specific to the given query on the given data, for optimizing the CPU cache performance of the subsequent join phase of the algorithm, and (2) to decide which join phase algorithm best suits this specific query. We show how inspector joins, employing novel statistics and specialized indexes, match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art cache-friendly hash join algorithms. For example, when run on eight or more processors, our experiments show that inspector joins offer 1.1-1.4X speedups over these previous algorithms, with the speedup increasing as the number of processors increases."

    :abstractText: Thread-level speculation (TLS) allows us to automatically parallelize general-purpose programs by supporting parallel execution of threads that might not actually be independent. In this article, we focus on one important limitation of program performance under TLS, which stalls as a result of synchronizing and forwarding scalar values between speculative threads that would otherwise cause frequent data dependences and, hence, failed speculation. Using SPECint benchmarks that have been automatically transformed by our compiler to exploit TLS, we present, evaluate in detail, and compare both compiler and hardware techniques for improving the communication of scalar values. We find that through our dataflow algorithms for three increasingly aggressive instruction scheduling techniques, the compiler can drastically reduce the critical forwarding path introduced by the synchronization and forwarding of scalar values. We also show that hardware techniques for reducing synchronization can be complementary to compiler scheduling, but that the additional performance benefits are minimal and are generally not worth the cost.

    :abstractText: As the disparity between processor and memory speeds continues to grow, memory latency is becoming an increasingly important performance bottleneck. While software-controlled prefetching is an attractive technique for tolerating this latency, its success has been limited thus far to array-based numeric codes. In this paper, we expand the scope of automatic compiler-inserted prefetching to also include the recursive data structures commonly found in pointer-based applications.We propose three compiler-based prefetching schemes, and automate the most widely applicable scheme (greedy prefetching) in an optimizing research compiler. Our experimental results demonstrate that compiler-inserted prefetching can offer significant performance gains on both uniprocessors and large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors.

    :abstractText: "Latency-tolerance techniques offer the potential for bridging the ever-increasing speed gap between the memory subsystem and today's high-performance processors. However, to fully exploit the benefit of these techniques, one must be careful to apply them only to the dynamic references that are likely to suffer cache misses\xC2\xBFotherwise the runtime overheads can potentially offset any gains. In this paper, we focus on isolating dynamic miss instances in nonnumeric applications, which is a difficult but important problem. Although compilers cannot statically analyze data locality in nonnumeric applications, one viable approach is to use profiling information to measure the actual miss behavior. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art in cache miss profiling (which we call summary profiling) is inadequate for references with intermediate miss ratios\xC2\xBFit either misses opportunities to hide latency, or else inserts overhead that is unnecessary. To overcome this problem, we propose and evaluate a new profiling technique that helps predict which dynamic instances of a static memory reference will hit or miss in the cache: correlation profiling. Our experimental results demonstrate that roughly half of the 21 nonnumeric applications we study can potentially enjoy significant reductions in memory stall time by exploiting at least one of the three forms of correlation profiling we consider: control-flow correlation, self correlation, and global correlation. In addition, our detailed case studies illustrate that self correlation succeeds because a given reference's cache outcomes often contain repeated patterns and control-flow correlation succeeds because cache outcomes are often call-chain dependent. Finally, we suggest a number of ways to exploit correlation profiling in practice and demonstrate that software prefetching can achieve better performance on a modern superscalar processor when directed by correlation profiling rather than summary profiling information."

    :abstractText: "Current operating systems offer poor performance when a numeric application's working set does not fit in main memory. As a result, programmers who wish to solve &ldquo;out-of-core&rdquo; problems efficiently are typically faced with the onerous task of rewriting an application to use explicit I/O operations (e.g., read/write). In this paper, we propose and evaluate a fully automatic technique which liberates the programmer from this task, provides high performance, and requires only minimal changes to current operating systems. In our scheme the compiler provides the crucial information on future access patterns without burdening the programmer; the operating system supports nonbinding prefetch and release hints for managing I/O; and the operating systems cooperates with a run-time layer to accelerate performance by adapting to dynamic behavior and minimizing prefetch overhead. This approach maintains the abstraction of unlimited virtual memory for the programmer, gives the compiler the flexibility to aggressively insert prefetches ahead of references, and gives the operating system the flexibility to arbitrate between the competing resource demands of multiple applications. We implemented our compiler analysis within the SUIF compiler, and used it to target implementations of our run-time and OS support on both research and commercial systems (Hurricane and IRIX 6.5, respectively). Our experimental results show large performance gains for out-of-core scientific applications on both systems: more than 50% of the I/O stall time has been eliminated in most cases, thus translating into overall speedups of roughly twofold in many cases."

    :abstractText: Memory latency is an important bottleneck in system performance that cannot be adequately solved by hardware alone. Several promising software techniques have been shown to address this problem successfully in specific situations. However, the generality of these software approaches has been limited because current architecturtes do not provide a fine-grained, low-overhead mechanism for observing and reacting to memory behavior directly. To fill this need, this article proposes a new class of memory operations called informing memory operations, which essentially consist of a memory operatin combined (either implicitly or explicitly) with a conditional branch-and-ink operation that is taken only if the reference suffers a cache miss. This article describes two different implementations of informing memory operations. One is based on a cache-outcome condition code, and the other is based on low-overhead traps. We find that modern in-order-issue and out-of-order-issue superscalar processors already contain the bulk of the necessary hardware support. We describe how a number of software-based memory optimizations can exploit informing memory operations to enhance performance, and we look at cache coherence with fine-grained access control as a case study. Our performance results demonstrate that the runtime overhead of invoking the informing mechanism on the Alpha 21164 and MIPS R10000 processors is generally small enough to provide considerable flexibility to hardware and software designers, and that the cache coherence application has improved performance compared to other current solutions. We believe that the inclusion of informing memory operations in future processors may spur even more innovative performance optimizations.

    :abstractText: The large latency of memory accesses in large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors is a key obstacle to achieving high processor utilization. Software-controlled prefetching is a technique for tolerating memory latency by explicitly executing instructions to move data close to the processor before the data are actually needed. To minimize the burden on the programmer, compiler support is needed to automatically insert prefetch instructions into the code. A key challenge when inserting prefetches is ensuring that the overheads of prefetching do not outweigh the benefits. While previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of hand-inserted prefetching in multiprocessor applications, the benefit of compiler-inserted prefetching in practice has remained an open question. This article proposes and evaluates a new compiler algorithm for inserting prefetches into multiprocessor code. The proposed algorithm attempts to minimize overheads by only issuing prefetches for references that are predicted to suffer cache misses. The algorithm can prefetch both dense-matrix and sparse-matrix codes, thus covering a large fraction of scientific applications. We have implemented our algorithm in the SUIF(Stanford University Intermediate Format) optimizing compiler. The results of our detailed architectural simulations demonstrate that compiler-inserted prefetching can improve the speed of some parallel applications by as much as a factor of two.

    :abstractText: "Multithreaded processor architectures are becoming increasingly commonplace: many current and upcoming designs support chip multiprocessing, simultaneous multithreading, or both. While it is relatively straightforward to use these architectures to improve the throughput of a multithreaded or multiprogrammed workload, the real challenge is how to easily create parallel software to allow single programs to effectively exploit all of this raw performance potential. One promising technique for overcoming this problem is Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), which enables the compiler to optimistically create parallel threads despite uncertainty as to whether those threads are actually independent. In this article, we propose and evaluate a design for supporting TLS that seamlessly scales both within a chip and beyond because it is a straightforward extension of write-back invalidation-based cache coherence (which itself scales both up and down). Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme performs well on single-chip multiprocessors where the first level caches are either private or shared. For our private-cache design, the program performance of two of 13 general purpose applications studied improves by 86&percnt; and 56&percnt;, four others by more than 8&percnt;, and an average across all applications of 16&percnt;---confirming that TLS is a promising way to exploit the naturally-multithreaded processing resources of future computer systems."

    :abstractText: Hash join algorithms suffer from extensive CPU cache stalls. This article shows that the standard hash join algorithm for disk-oriented databases (i.e. GRACE) spends over 80&percnt; of its user time stalled on CPU cache misses, and explores the use of CPU cache prefetching to improve its cache performance. Applying prefetching to hash joins is complicated by the data dependencies, multiple code paths, and inherent randomness of hashing. We present two techniques, group prefetching and software-pipelined prefetching, that overcome these complications. These schemes achieve 1.29--4.04X speedups for the join phase and 1.37--3.49X speedups for the partition phase over GRACE and simple prefetching approaches. Moreover, compared with previous cache-aware approaches (i.e. cache partitioning), the schemes are at least 36&percnt; faster on large relations and do not require exclusive use of the CPU cache to be effective. Finally, comparing the elapsed real times when disk I/Os are in the picture, our cache prefetching schemes achieve 1.12--1.84X speedups for the join phase and 1.06--1.60X speedups for the partition phase over the GRACE hash join algorithm.

    :abstractText: The backend database system is often the performance bottleneck when running web applications. A common approach to scale the database component is query result caching, but it faces the challenge of maintaining a high cache hit rate while efficiently ensuring cache consistency as the database is updated. In this paper we introduce Ferdinand, the first proxy-based cooperative query result cache with fully distributed consistency management. To maintain a high cache hit rate, Ferdinand uses both a local query result cache on each proxy server and a distributed cache. Consistency management is implemented with a highly scalable publish/subscribe system. We implement a fully functioning Ferdinand prototype and evaluate its performance compared to several alternative query-caching approaches, showing that our high cache hit rate and consistency management are both critical for Ferdinand's performance gains over existing systems.

    :abstractText: "Instruction-grain lifeguards monitor the events of a running application at the level of individual instructions in order to identify and help mitigate application bugs and security exploits. Because such lifeguards impose a 10-100X slowdown on existing platforms, previous studies have proposed hardware designs to accelerate lifeguard processing. However, these accelerators are either tailored to a specific class of lifeguards or suitable only for monitoring singlethreaded programs. We present ParaLog, the first design of a system enabling fast online parallel monitoring of multithreaded parallel applications. ParaLog supports a broad class of software-defined lifeguards. We show how three existing accelerators can be enhanced to support online multithreaded monitoring, dramatically reducing lifeguard overheads. We identify and solve several challenges in monitoring parallel applications and/or parallelizing these accelerators, including (i) enforcing inter-thread data dependences, (ii) dealing with inter-thread effects that are not reflected in coherence traffic, (iii) dealing with unmonitored operating system activity, and (iv) ensuring lifeguards can access shared metadata with negligible synchronization overheads. We present our system design for both Sequentially Consistent and Total Store Ordering processors. We implement and evaluate our design on a 16 core simulated CMP, using benchmarks from SPLASH-2 and PARSEC and two lifeguards: a data-flow tracking lifeguard and a memory-access checker lifeguard. Our results show that (i) our parallel accelerators improve performance by 2-9X and 1.13-3.4X for our two lifeguards, respectively, (ii) we are 5-126X faster than the time-slicing approach required by existing techniques, and (iii) our average overheads for applications with eight threads are 51% and 28% for the two lifeguards, respectively."

    :abstractText: Online program monitoring is an effective technique for detecting bugs and security attacks in running applications. Extending these tools to monitor parallel programs is challenging because the tools must account for inter-thread dependences and relaxed memory consistency models. Existing tools assume sequential consistency and often slow down the monitored program by orders of magnitude. In this paper, we present a novel approach that avoids these pitfalls by not relying on strong consistency models or detailed inter-thread dependence tracking. Instead, we only assume that events in the distant past on all threads have become visible; we make no assumptions on (and avoid the overheads of tracking) the relative ordering of more recent events on other threads. To overcome the potential state explosion of considering all the possible orderings among recent events, we adapt two techniques from static dataflow analysis, reaching definitions and reaching expressions, to this new domain of dynamic parallel monitoring. Significant modifications to these techniques are proposed to ensure the correctness and efficiency of our approach. We show how our adapted analysis can be used in two popular memory and security tools. We prove that our approach does not miss errors, and sacrifices precision only due to the lack of a relative ordering among recent events. Moreover, our simulation study on a collection of Splash-2 and Parsec 2.0 benchmarks running a memory-checking tool on a hardware-assisted logging platform demonstrates the potential benefits in trading off a very low false positive rate for (i) reduced overhead and (ii) the ability to run on relaxed consistency models.

    :abstractText: "Many parallel applications exhibit unpredictable communication between threads, leading to contention for shared objects. The choice of contention management strategy impacts strongly the performance and scalability of these applications: spinning provides maximum performance but wastes significant processor resources, while blocking-based approaches conserve processor resources but introduce high overheads on the critical path of computation. Under situations of high or changing load, the operating system complicates matters further with arbitrary scheduling decisions which often preempt lock holders, leading to long serialization delays until the preempted thread resumes execution. We observe that contention management is orthogonal to the problems of scheduling and load management and propose to decouple them so each may be solved independently and effectively. To this end, we propose a load control mechanism which manages the number of active threads in the system separately from any contention which may exist. By isolating contention management from damaging interactions with the OS scheduler, we combine the efficiency of spinning with the robustness of blocking. The proposed load control mechanism results in stable, high performance for both lightly and heavily loaded systems, requires no special privileges or modifications at the OS level, and can be implemented as a library which benefits existing code."

    :abstractText: Dynamic correctness checking tools (a.k.a. lifeguards) can detect a wide array of correctness issues, such as memory, security, and concurrency misbehavior, in unmodified executables at run time. However, lifeguards that are implemented using dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) often slow down the monitored application by 10-50X, while proposals that replace DBI with hardware still see 3-8X slowdowns. The remaining overhead is the cost of performing the lifeguard analysis itself. In this paper, we explore compiler optimization techniques to reduce this overhead. The lifeguard software is typically structured as a set of event-driven handlers, where the events are individual instructions in the monitored application's dynamic instruction stream. We propose to decouple the lifeguard checking code from the application that it is monitoring so that the lifeguard analysis can be invoked at the granularity of hot paths in the monitored application. In this way, we are able to find many more opportunities for eliminating redundant work in the lifeguard analysis, even starting with well-optimized applications and hand-tuned lifeguard handlers. Experimental results with two lifeguard frameworks - one DBI-based and one hardware-assisted - show significant reduction in monitoring overhead.

    :abstractText: "This paper describes a computer architecture, Spatial Computation (SC), which is based on the translation of high-level language programs directly into hardware structures. SC program implementations are completely distributed, with no centralized control. SC circuits are optimized for wires at the expense of computation units.In this paper we investigate a particular implementation of SC: ASH (Application-Specific Hardware). Under the assumption that computation is cheaper than communication, ASH replicates computation units to simplify interconnect, building a system which uses very simple, completely dedicated communication channels. As a consequence, communication on the datapath never requires arbitration; the only arbitration required is for accessing memory. ASH relies on very simple hardware primitives, using no associative structures, no multiported register files, no scheduling logic, no broadcast, and no clocks. As a consequence, ASH hardware is fast and extremely power efficient.In this work we demonstrate three features of ASH: (1) that such architectures can be built by automatic compilation of C programs; (2) that distributed computation is in some respects fundamentally different from monolithic superscalar processors; and (3) that ASIC implementations of ASH use three orders of magnitude less energy compared to high-end superscalar processors, while being on average only 33% slower in performance (3.5x worst-case)."

    :abstractText: Spatial Computing (SC) has been shown to be an energy-efficient model for implementing program kernels. In this paper we explore the feasibility of using SC for more than small kernels. To this end, we evaluate the performance and energy efficiency of entire applications on Tartan, a general-purpose architecture which integrates a reconfigurable fabric (RF) with a superscalar core. Our compiler automatically partitions and compiles an application into an instruction stream for the core and a configuration for the RF. We use a detailed simulator to capture both timing and energy numbers for all parts of the system.Our results indicate that a hierarchical RF architecture, designed around a scalable interconnect, is instrumental in harnessing the benefits of spatial computation. The interconnect uses static configuration and routing at the lower levels and a packet-switched, dynamically-routed network at the top level. Tartan is most energyefficient when almost all of the application is mapped to the RF, indicating the need for the RF to support most general-purpose programming constructs. Our initial investigation reveals that such a system can provide, on average, an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay compared to an aggressive superscalar core on single-threaded workloads.

    :abstractText: Future deep sub-micron technologies will be characterized by large parametric variations, which could make asynchronous design an attractive solution for use on large scale. However, the investment in asynchronous CAD tools does not approach that in synchronous ones. Even when asynchronous tools leverage existing synchronous toolflows, they introduce large area and speed overheads. This paper proposes several heuristic and optimal algorithms, based on timing interval analysis, for improving existing asynchronous CAD solutions by optimizing area. The optimized circuits are 2.4 times smaller for an optimal algorithm and 1.8 times smaller for a heuristic one than the existing solutions. The optimized circuits are also shown to be resilient to large parametric variations, yielding better average-case latencies than their synchronous counterparts.

    :abstractText: "In this paper we present the internal representation and optimizations used by the CASH compiler for improving the memory parallelism of pointer-based programs. CASH uses an SSA-based representation for memory, which compactly summarizes both control-flow-and dependence information.In CASH, memory optimization is a four-step process: (1)first an initial, relatively coarse, representation of memory dependences is built; (2) next, unnecessary memory dependences are removed using dependence tests; (3) third, redundant memory operations are removed (4)finally, parallelism is increased by pipelining memory accesses in loops. While the first three steps above are very general, the loop pipelining transformations are particularly applicable for spatial computation, which is the primary target of CASH.The redundant memory removal optimizations presented are: load/store hoisting (subsuming partial redundancy elimination and common-subexpression elimination), load-after-store removal, store-before-store removal (dead store removal) and loop-invariant load motion.One of our loop pipelining transformations is a new form of loop parallelization, called loop decoupling. This transformation separates independent memory accesses within a loop body into several independent loops, which are allowed dynamically to slip with respect to each other. A new computational primitive, a token generator is used to dynamically control the amount of slip, allowing maximum freedom, while guaranteeing that no memory dependences are violated."

    :abstractText: Register allocation is one of the most important optimizations a compiler performs. Conventional graph-coloring based register allocators are fast and do well on regular, RISC-like, architectures, but perform poorly on irregular, CISC-like, architectures with few registers and non-orthogonal instruction sets. At the other extreme, optimal register allocators based on integer linear programming are capable of fully modeling and exploiting the peculiarities of irregular architectures but do not scale well. We introduce the idea of a progressive allocator. A progressive allocator finds an initial allocation of quality comparable to a conventional allocator, but as more time is allowed for computation the quality of the allocation approaches optimal. This paper presents a progressive register allocator which uses a multi-commodity network flow model to elegantly represent the intricacies of irregular architectures. We evaluate our allocator as a substitute for gcc's local register allocation pass.

    :abstractText: Instruction selection is a key component of code generation. High quality instruction selection is of particular importance in the embedded space where complex instruction sets are common and code size is a prime concern. Although instruction selection on tree expressions is a well understood and easily solved problem, instruction selection on directed acyclic graphs is NP-complete. In this paper we present NOLTIS, a near-optimal, linear time instruction selection algorithm for DAG expressions. NOLTIS is easy to implement, fast, and effective with a demonstrated average code size improvement of 5.1% compared to the traditional tree decomposition and tiling approach.

    :abstractText: Arbitrary memory dependencies and variable latency memory systems are major obstacles to the synthesis of large-scale ASIC systems in high-level synthesis. This paper presents SOMA, a synthesis framework for constructing Memory Access Network (MAN) architectures that inherently enforce memory consistency in the presence of dynamic memory access dependencies. A fundamental bottleneck in any such network is arbitrating between concurrent accesses to a shared memory resource. To alleviate this bottleneck, SOMA uses an application-specific concurrency analysis technique to predict the dynamic memory parallelism profile of the application. This is then used to customize the MAN architecture. Depending on the parallelism profile, the MAN may be optimized for latency, throughput or both. The optimized MAN is automatically synthesized into gate-level structural Verilog using a flexible library of network building blocks. SOMA has been successfully integrated into an automated C-to-hardware synthesis flow, which generates standard cell circuits from unrestricted ANSI-C programs. Post-layout experiments demonstrate that application specific MAN construction significantly improves power and performance.

    :abstractText: We present a system-level technique to analyze the impact of design optimizations on system-level timing dependencies. This technique enables us to speed up the design cycle by substituting, in the design the loop, the time-consuming simulation step with a fast timing update routine. As a result, we can significantly reduce the design time from on the order of hours/days to the order of seconds/minutes. The update algorithm is defined on the Transaction Level Model (TLM) and can be used by any design flow that invokes TLM-based optimizations. This algorithm has linear-time complexity in the program size and experimental results indicate that any loss of accuracy due to this technique is negligible (

    :abstractText: Asynchronous circuits are increasingly attractive as low power or high-performance replacements to synchronous designs. A key part of these circuits are asynchronous micropipelines; unfortunatelly, the existing micropipeline styles either improve performance or decrease power consumption, but not both. Very often, the pipeline register plays a crucial role in these cost metrics. In this paper we introduce a new register design, called self-resetting latches, for asynchronous micropipelines which bridges the gap between fast, but power hungry, latch-based designs and slow, but low power, flip-flop designs. The energy-delay metric for large asynchronous systems implemented with self-resetting latches is, on average, 41% better than latch-based designs and 15% better than flip-flop designs.

    :abstractText: An effective method for focusing optimization effort on the most important parts of a design is to examine those elements on the critical path. Traditionally, the critical path is defined at the RTL level, as the longest path in the combinational logic between clocked registers. In this paper, we present a system-level timing analysis technique to define the concept of a Global Critical Path (GCP), for predicting system-level performance. We show how the GCP can be used as a theoretical and practical tool for understanding, summarizing and optimizing the behavior of highly concurrent self-timed circuits. We formally define the GCP and show how it can be constructed using a discrete event model and hardware profiling techniques. The GCP provides valuable insight into the control-path behavior of circuits and in finding system-level bottlenecks. We have incorporated the GCP construction and analysis framework into a high-level synthesis and simulation toolchain, thus enabling complete automation in modeling, analysis and optimization.

    :abstractText: In this paper we describe a peer-to-peer interface between processor cores and reconfigurable fabrics. The main advantage of the peer-to-peer model is that it greatly expandsthe scope of application for reconfigurable computing and hence its potential benefits. The primary extension in our model is that "code" on the reconfigurable hardware unit is allowed to invoke routines both on the reconfigurable unit itself and on the fixed logic processor. We describe the software constructs and compilation mechanisms needed for such an architecture, including a detailed description of the interface between the two parts of the application.

CPR uses sub-graph matching to identify the parts of an application which are most important to achieve high performance. Using CPR as a guide we implemented a few macros for a macro-generator library, which yielded significant improvement in both the quality of configurations and speed of compilation.

    :abstractText: This extended abstract defines a class of architectures for pipeline reconfigurable FPGAs by parameterizing a generic model. This class of architectures is sufficiently general to allow exploration of the most important design trade-offs. The parame ters include the word size and LUT size, the number of global busses and registers associated with each logic block, and the horizontal interconnect within each stripe. We have developed an area model for the architecture that allows us to quickly estimate the area of an instance of the architectural class as a function of the parameter values. We compare the estimates generated by this model to one instance of the architecture that we have designed and fabricated.

    :abstractText: As the size of reconfigurable fabrics increases we can envision entire applications being mapped to a reconfigurable device; not just the code, but also the memory. These larger circuits, unfortunately, will suffer from the problem of a growing memory bottleneck. In this paper we explore how mobile memory techniques, inspired by cache-only memory architectures, can be applied to help solve this problem. The basic idea is to move the memory to the location of the accessor. Using both an analytical model and simulation we investigate several different memory movement algorithms. The results show that mobility can, on average, decrease memory latency 2x; which translates into speedup of about 15%.

    :abstractText: Fault tolerance is becoming an increasingly important issue, especially in mission-critical applications where data integrity is a paramount concern. Performance, however, remains a large driving force in the market place. Runtime reconfigurable hardware architectures have the power to balance fault tolerance with performance, allowing the amount of fault tolerance to be tuned at run-time. This paper describes a new built-in self-test designed to run on, and take advantage of, runtime reconfigurable architectures, using the PipeRench architecture as a model. In addition, this paper introduces a new metric by which a user can set the desired fault tolerance of a runtime reconfigurable device.

    :abstractText: Lenient languages, such as Id90, have been touted as among the best functional languages for massively parallel machines [ArvindHN88]. Lenient evaluation combines non-strict semantics with eager evaluation [Traub91]. Non-strictness gives these languages more expressive power than strict semantics, while eager evaluation ensures the highest degree of parallelism. Unfortunately, non-strictness incurs a large overhead, as it requires dynamic scheduling and synchronization. As a result, many powerful program analysis techniques have been developed to statically determine when non-strictness is not required [ClackP85,Traub91,Schauser94]. This paper studies a large set of lenient programs and quantifies the degree of non-strictness they require. We identify several forms of non-strictness, including functional, conditional, and data structure non-strictness. Surprisingly, most Id90 programs require neither functional nor conditional non-strictness. Many benchmark programs, however, make use of a limited form of data structure non-strictness. The paper refutes the myth that lenient programs require extensive non-strictness.

    :abstractText: While reconfigurable computing promises to deliver incomparable performance, it is still a marginal technology due to the high cost of developing and upgrading applications. Hardware virtualization can be used to significantly reduce both these costs. In this paper we describe the benefits of hardware virtualization, and show how it can be achieved using a combination of pipeline reconfiguration and run-time scheduling of both configuration streams and data streams. The result is PipeRench, an architecture that supports robust compilation and provides forward compatibility. Our preliminary performance analysis predicts that PipeRench will outperform commercial FPGAs and DSPs in both overall performance and in performance per mm2.

Devices and interconnects can be made from a variety of molecules and materials including bistable and switchable organic molecules, carbon nanotubes, and, single-crystal semiconductor nanowires. They can be self-assembled into organized structures and attached onto lithographic substrates. This tutorial reviews emerging molecular-scale electronics technology for CAD and system designers and highlights where ICCAD research can help support this technology.

We show that the issues and potential solutions facing designers are technology independent and arise mainly from shrinking device sizes and an increase in the number of devices available. We explore how it is possible to use some of the devices that will be available to help ease design complexity as well as overcome process related challenges such as limited layout freedom, increased defect densities, timing constraints, and power dissipation.

    :abstractText: Stalls, due to mis-matches in communication rates, are a major performance obstacle in pipelined circuits. If the rate of data production is faster than the rate of consumption, the resulting design performs slower than when the communication rate is matched. This can be remedied by inserting pipeline buffers (to temporarily hold data), allowing the producer to proceed if the consumer is not ready to accept data. The problem of deciding which channels need these buffers (and how many) for an arbitrary communication profile is called the slack matching problem; the optimal solution to this problem has been shown to be NP-complete. In this paper, we present a heuristic that uses knowledge of the communication protocol to explicitly model these bottlenecks, and an iterative algorithm to progressively remove these bottlenecks by inserting buffers. We apply this algorithm to asynchronous circuits, and show that it naturally handles large designs with arbitrarily cyclic and acyclic topologies, which exhibit various types of control choice. The heuristic is efficient, achieving linear time complexity in practice, and produces solutions that (a) achieve up to 60% performance speedup on large media processing kernels, and (b) can either be verified to be optimal, or the approximation margin can be bounded.

    :abstractText: We define operation chaining (op-chaining) as an optimization problem to determine the optimal pipeline depth for balancing performance against energy demands in pipelined asynchronous designs. Since there are no clock period requirements, asynchronous pipeline stages can have non-uniform latencies. We exploit this fact to coalesce several stages together thereby saving power and area due to the elimination of control-path resources from the pipeline. The trade-off is potentially reduced pipeline parallelism. In this paper, we formally define this optimization as a graph covering problem, which finds sub-graphs that will be synthesized as an opchained pipeline stage. We then define the solution space for provably correct solutions and present an algorithm to efficiently search this space. The search technique partitions the graph based on post-dominator relationships to find sub-graphs that are potential op-chain candidates. We use knowledge of the Global Critical Path (GCP) [13] to evaluate the performance impact of accepting a candidate sub-graph and formulate a heuristic cost function to model this trade-off. The algorithm has a quadratic-time complexity in the size of the dataflow graph. We have implemented this algorithm within an automated asynchronous synthesis toolchain [12]. Experimental evidence from applying the algorithm on several media processing kernels reveals that the average energy-delay and energy-delay-area products improve by about 1.4x and 1.8x respectively, with a maximum improvement of 5x and 18x.

    :abstractText: In this paper we present NIFDY, a network interface that uses admission control to reduce congestion and ensures that packets are received by a processor in the order in which they were sent, even if the underlying network delivers the packets out of order. The basic idea behind NIFDY is that each processor is allowed to have at most one outstanding packet to any other processor unless the destination processor has granted the sender the right to send multiple unacknowledged packets. Further, there is a low upper limit on the number of outstanding packets to all processors.We present results from simulations of a variety of networks (meshes, tori, butterflies, and fat trees) and traffic patterns to verify NIFDY's efficacy. Our simulations show that NIFDY increases throughput and decreases overhead. The utility of NIFDY increases as a network's bisection bandwidth decreases. When combined with the increased payload allowed by in-order delivery NIFDY increases total bandwidth delivered for all networks. The resources needed to implement NIFDY are small and constant with respect to network size.

    :abstractText: The design challenge for large-scale multiprocessors is (1) to minimize communication overhead, (2) allow communication to overlap computation, and (3) coordinate the two without sacrificing processor cost/performance. We show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs. Research prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead, but poor processor cost/performance. We introduce a simple communication mechanism, Active Messages, show that it is intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility. Implementations on nCUBE/2 and CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory extension to C, Split-C. We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed. With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern. Hardware support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of enhancements to mainstream processors.

    :abstractText: The continuation of the remarkable exponential increases in processing power over the recent past faces imminent challenges due in part to the physics of deep-submicron CMOS devices and the costs of both chip masks and future fabrication plants. A promising solution to these problems is offered by an alternative to CMOS-based computing, chemically assembled electronic nanotechnology (CAEN). In this paper we outline how CAEN-based computing can become a reality. We briefly describe recent work in CAEN and how CAEN will affect computer architecture. We show how the inherently reconfigurable nature of CAEN devices can be exploited to provide high-density chips with defect tolerance at significantly reduced manufacturing costs. We develop a layered abstract architecture for CAEN-based computing devices and we present preliminary results which indicate that such devices will be competitive with CMOS circuits.

    :abstractText: "This paper uses an abstract machine approach to compare the mechanisms of two parallel machines: the J-Machine and the CM-5. High-level parallel programs are translated by a single optimizing compiler to a fine-grained abstract parallel machine, TAM. A final compilation step is unique to each machine and optimizes for specifics of the architecture. By determining the cost of the primitives and weighting them by their dynamic frequency in parallel programs, we quantify the effectiveness of the following mechanisms individually and in combination. Efficient processor/network coupling proves valuable. Message dispatch is found to be less valuable without atomic operations that allow the scheduling levels to cooperate. Multiple hardware contexts are of small value when the contexts cooperate and the compiler can partition the register set. Tagged memory provides little gain. Finally, the performance of the overall system is strongly influenced by the performance of the memory system and the frequency of control operations."

    :abstractText: As feature sizes shrink closer to single digit nanometer dimensions, defect tolerance will become increasingly important. This is true whether the chips are manufactured using top-down methods, such as photolithography, or bottom-up assembly processes such as Chemically Assembled Electronic Nanotechnology (CAEN). In this chapter, we examine the consequences of this increased rate of defects, and describe a defect tolerance methodology centered around reconfigurable devices, a scalable testing method, and dynamic place-and-route. We summarize some of our own results in this area as well as those of others, and enumerate some future research directions required to make nanometer-scale computing a reality.

    :abstractText: Shared-memory parallel programs can be highly non-deterministic due to the unpredictable order in which shared references are satisfied. However, deterministic execution is extremely important for debugging and can also be used for fault-tolerance and other replay-based algorihtms. We present a hardware/software design that allows the order of memory and the CPU''s. This log can then be used along with hardware and software control to replay execution. Simulation of several parallel programs shows that our device records no more than 1.17 MB/second for an application exhibiting fine-grained sharing behavior on a 16-way multiprocessor consisting of 12 MIP CPU''s. In addition, no probe effect on performance degradation is introduced. This represents several orders of magnitude improvement in both performance and log size over purely software-based methods proposed previously.

    :abstractText: This paper describes a global progressive register allocator, a register allocator that uses an expressive model of the register allocation problem to quickly find a good allocation and then progressively find better allocations until a provably optimal solution is found or a preset time limit is reached. The key contributions of this paper are an expressive model of global register allocation based on multicommodity network flows that explicitly represents spill code optimization, register preferences, copy insertion, and constant rematerialization; two fast, but effective, heuristic allocators based on this model; and a more elaborate progressive allocator that uses Lagrangian relaxation to compute the optimality of its allocations. Our progressive allocator demonstrates code size improvements as large as 16.75% compared to a traditional graph allocator. On average, we observe an initial improvement of 3.47%, which increases progressively to 6.84% as more time is permitted for compilation.

We present a new block partitioning algorithm, separation constraint partitioning, which is both more powerful and more flexible than previous algorithms. Our algorithm is guaranteed to derive maximal threads. We present a theoretical framework for proving the correctness of our partitioning approach, and we show how separation constraint partitioning makes interprocedural partitioning viable. We have implemented the partitioning algorithms in an Id90 compiler for workstations and parallel machines. Using this experimental platform, we quantify the effectiveness of different partitioning schemes on whole applications.

    :abstractText: With the proliferation of highly specialized embedded computer systems has come a diversification of workloads for computing devices. General-purpose processors are struggling to efficiently meet these applications' disparate needs, and custom hardware is rarely feasible. According to the authors, reconfigurable computing, which combines the flexibility of general-purpose processors with the efficiency of custom hardware, can provide the alternative.PipeRench and its associated compiler comprise the authors' new architecture for reconfigurable computing. Combined with a traditional digital signal processor, microcontroller, or general-purpose processor, PipeRench can support a system's various computing needs without requiring custom hardware.The authors describe the PipeRench architecture and how it solves some of the preexisting problems with FPGA architectures, such as logic granularity, configuration time, forward compatibility, hard constraints, and compilation time.

    :abstractText: While reconfigurable computing promises to deliver incomparable performance, it is still a marginal technology due to the high cost of developing and upgrading applications. Hardware virtualization can be used to significantly reduce both these costs. In this paper we describe the benefits of hardware virtualization, and show how it can be achieved using the technique of pipeline reconfiguration. The result is PipeRench, an architecture that supports robust compilation and provides forward compatibility. Our preliminary performance analysis on PipeRench predicts that it will outperform commercial FPGAs and DSPs in both overall performance and in performance normalized for silicon area over a broad range of problem sizes.

In a recent paper at \"Robotics: Science and Systems 2005,\" we analyzed a coordination system based on sequential single-item auctions. We showed that the coordination system is simple to implement and computation and communication efficient, and that the resulting sum of all travel distances in known terrain is guaranteed to be only a constant factor away from optimum. In this paper, we put these results in perspective by comparing our coordination system against those based on either parallel single-item auction, or combinatorial auctions, demonstrating that it combines the advantages of both."

    :abstractText: For a decade now, the RoboCup competition promotes research in robotics through soccer games between au- tonomous robot teams. The ability to coordinate the play- ers within such a team of robots is the key to the suc- cess of the team. Team coordination in a human soccer game is achieved through various team formations, tactics, and strategies. Unfortunately, research in the four-legged RoboCup league has focused mostly on single player skills, demonstrating only limited results in coordinated team play. In our work, we adapt and transfer formations, tactics, and strategies used by human soccer teams, such as the popular 4-4-2 scheme, to our four-legged RoboCup team Kouretes. We define roles for each player in all the cases we con- sider and we implement these roles using Petri Net Plans (PNP). The assignment of appropriate roles to players is performed dynamically during the game depending on the current game state using a simple communication scheme and a finite state machine. Our approach is implemented and tested on our four-legged RoboCup team. The proposed coordination scheme can be generalized and used in vari- ous robot team applications beyond robotic soccer, such as planetary exploration and search-and-rescue missions.

    :abstractText: "RoboCup is an annual international robotic soccer competition. One of its most popular divisions is the Four-Legged League, whereby each team consists of four fully autonomous Sony AIBO robots and researchers focus solely on software development over a standard robotic platform. To compete successfully each robot needs to address a variety of problems: visual object recognition, legged locomotion, localization, and team coordination. This paper focuses on the problem of visual object recognition and suggests a uniform approach for recognizing the key objects in the RoboCup 2007 field: the two goals, the two beacons (colored landmarks), and the ball. The proposed method processes the color-segmented camera image and delivers the type, as well as an estimate of the distance and the angle with respect to the robot, of each recognized object in the current field of view. Our approach is based on a number of procedures which are used uniformly for all three types of objects: horizontal and vertical scanning of the image, identification of large colored areas through a finite state machine, clustering of colored areas through histograms, formation of a bounding box indicating possible presence of an object, and customized filtering for removing implausible indications. Our approach is compared against the approaches of two RoboCup teams (German Team 2004 and SPQR-Legged 2006) and is shown to be equally good or better in many cases. The proposed approach has been used successfully by Team Kouretes of the Technical University of Crete, Greece during various RoboCup events."

    :abstractText: Several approximate policy iteration schemes without value functions, which focus on policy representation using classifiers and address policy learning as a supervised learning problem, have been proposed recently. Finding good policies with such methods requires not only an appropriate classifier, but also reliable examples of best actions, covering the state space sufficiently. Up to this time, little work has been done on appropriate covering schemes and on methods for reducing the sample complexity of such methods, especially in continuous state spaces. This paper focuses on the simplest possible covering scheme (a discretized grid over the state space) and performs a sample-complexity comparison between the simplest (and previously commonly used) rollout sampling allocation strategy, which allocates samples equally at each state under consideration, and an almost as simple method, which allocates samples only as needed and requires significantly fewer samples.

    :abstractText: "Objective: To develop a model to predict the bleeding source and identify the cohort amongst patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who require urgent intervention, including endoscopy. Patients with acute GIB, an unpredictable event, are most commonly evaluated and managed by non-gastroenterologists. Rapid and consistently reliable risk stratification of patients with acute GIB for urgent endoscopy may potentially improve outcomes amongst such patients by targeting scarce healthcare resources to those who need it the most. Design and methods: Using ICD-9 codes for acute GIB, 189 patients with acute GIB and all available data variables required to develop and test models were identified from a hospital medical records database. Data on 122 patients was utilized for development of the model and on 67 patients utilized to perform comparative analysis of the models. Clinical data such as presenting signs and symptoms, demographic data, presence of co-morbidities, laboratory data and corresponding endoscopic diagnosis and outcomes were collected. Clinical data and endoscopic diagnosis collected for each patient was utilized to retrospectively ascertain optimal management for each patient. Clinical presentations and corresponding treatment was utilized as training examples. Eight mathematical models including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), shrunken centroid (SC), random forest (RF), logistic regression, and boosting were trained and tested. The performance of these models was compared using standard statistical analysis and ROC curves. Results: Overall the random forest model best predicted the source, need for resuscitation, and disposition with accuracies of approximately 80% or higher (accuracy for endoscopy was greater than 75%). The area under ROC curve for RF was greater than 0.85, indicating excellent performance by the random forest model. Conclusion: While most mathematical models are effective as a decision support system for evaluation and management of patients with acute GIB, in our testing, the RF model consistently demonstrated the best performance. Amongst patients presenting with acute GIB, mathematical models may facilitate the identification of the source of GIB, need for intervention and allow optimization of care and healthcare resource allocation; these however require further validation."

    :abstractText: Reinforcement Learning methods for controlling stochastic processes typically assume a small and discrete action space. While continuous action spaces are quite common in real-world problems, the most common approach still employed in practice is coarse discretization of the action space. This paper presents a novel method, called Binary Action Search, for realizing continuousaction policies by searching efficiently the entire action range through increment and decrement modifications to the values of the action variables according to an internal binary policy defined over an augmented state space. The proposed approach essentially approximates any continuous action space to arbitrary resolution and can be combined with any discrete-action reinforcement learning algorithm for learning continuous-action policies. Binary Action Search eliminates the restrictive modification steps of Adaptive Action Modification and requires no temporal action locality in the domain. Our approach is coupled with two well-known reinforcement learning algorithms (Least-Squares Policy Iteration and Fitted Q-Iteration) and its use and properties are thoroughly investigated and demonstrated on the continuous state-action Inverted Pendulum, Double Integrator, and Car on the Hill domains.

    :abstractText: Motivated by recent proposals that view a reinforcement learning problem as a collection of classification problems, we investigate various aspects of policy representation using classifiers. In particular, we derive optimal policies for two standard reinforcement learning domains (inverted pendulum and mountain car) in both deterministic and stochastic versions and we examine their internal structure. We then proceed in an evaluation of the representational ability of a variety of classifiers for these policies, using both a multi-class and a binary formulation of the classification problem. Finally, we evaluate the actual performance of the policies learned by the classifiers in the original control problem as a function of the amount of training examples provided. Our results offer significant insight in making the reinforcement-learning-via-classification technology successfully applicable to hard learning problems.

    :abstractText: Low-cost robots with a large number of degrees of freedom are becoming increasingly popular, nevertheless their programming is still a domain for experts. This paper introduces the Kouretes Motion Editor (KME), a freely-available interactive software tool for designing complex motion patterns on robots with many degrees of freedom using intuitive means. KME allows for a TCP/IP connection to a real or simulated robot, over which various robot poses can be communicated to or from the robot and manipulated locally using the KME graphical user interface. This portability and flexibility enables the user to work under different modes, with different robots, using different host machines. KME is originally designed for the Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot which features a total of 21 degrees of freedom, but can be easily customized for other robots. KME has been employed successfully by Kouretes, the RoboCup team of the Technical University of Crete, for designing various special actions at the RoboCup 2008 competition (Standard Platform League).

    :abstractText: "Automatic document summarization is a problem of creating a document surrogate that adequately represents the full document content. We aim at a summarization system that can replicate the quality of summaries created by humans. In this paper we investigate the machine learning method for extracting full sentences from documents based on the document semantic graph structure. In particular, we explore how the Support Vector Machines (SVM) learning method is affected by the quality of linguistic analyses and the corresponding semantic graph representations. We apply two types of linguistic analysis: (1) a simple part-of-speech tagging of noun phrases and verbs and (2) full logical form analysis which identifies Subject-Predicate-Object triples, and then build the semantic graphs. We train the SVM classifier to identify summary nodes and use these nodes to extract sentences. Experiments with the DUC 2002 and CAST datasets show that the SVM based extraction of sentences does not differ significantly for the simple and the sophisticated syntactic analysis. In both cases the graph attributes used in learning are essential for the classifier performance and the quality of extracted summaries."

    :abstractText: "We present a unified model of what was traditionally viewed as two separate tasks: data association and intensity tracking of multiple topics over time. In the data association part, the task is to assign a topic (a class) to each data point, and the intensity tracking part models the bursts and changes in intensities of topics over time. Our approach to this problem combines an extension of Factorial Hidden Markov models for topic intensity tracking with exponential order statistics for implicit data association. Experiments on text and email datasets show that the interplay of classification and topic intensity tracking improves the accuracy of both classification and intensity tracking. Even a little noise in topic assignments can mislead the traditional algorithms. However, our approach detects correct topic intensities even with 30% topic noise."

    :abstractText: We present a detailed study of network evolution by analyzing four large online social networks with full temporal information about node and edge arrivals. For the first time at such a large scale, we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks. Using a methodology based on the maximum-likelihood principle, we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies, and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks. Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non-local preferential attachment. Based on our observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes. Each node then independently initiates edges according to a "gap" process, selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle-closing model free of any parameters. We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out-degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases. Finally, we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale.

We observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model. We analyze how user behavior varies within user communities defined by a recommendation network. Product purchases follow a &lsquo;long tail&rsquo; where a significant share of purchases belongs to rarely sold items. We establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies communities, product, and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.

    :abstractText: We present a study of anonymized data capturing a month of high-level communication activities within the whole of the Microsoft Messenger instant-messaging system. We examine characteristics and patterns that emerge from the collective dynamics of large numbers of people, rather than the actions and characteristics of individuals. The dataset contains summary properties of 30 billion conversations among 240 million people. From the data, we construct a communication graph with 180 million nodes and 1.3 billion undirected edges, creating the largest social network constructed and analyzed to date. We report on multiple aspects of the dataset and synthesized graph. We find that the graph is well-connected and robust to node removal. We investigate on a planetary-scale the oft-cited report that people are separated by "six degrees of separation" and find that the average path length among Messenger users is 6.6. We find that people tend to communicate more with each other when they have similar age, language, and location, and that cross-gender conversations are both more frequent and of longer duration than conversations with the same gender.

    :abstractText: A large body of work has been devoted to identifying community structure in networks. A community is often though of as a set of nodes that has more connections between its members than to the remainder of the network. In this paper, we characterize as a function of size the statistical and structural properties of such sets of nodes. We define the network community profile plot, which characterizes the "best" possible community - according to the conductance measure - over a wide range of size scales, and we study over 70 large sparse real-world networks taken from a wide range of application domains. Our results suggest a significantly more refined picture of community structure in large real-world networks than has been appreciated previously. Our most striking finding is that in nearly every network dataset we examined, we observe tight but almost trivial communities at very small scales, and at larger size scales, the best possible communities gradually "blend in" with the rest of the network and thus become less "community-like." This behavior is not explained, even at a qualitative level, by any of the commonly-used network generation models. Moreover, this behavior is exactly the opposite of what one would expect based on experience with and intuition from expander graphs, from graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional structure, and from small social networks that have served as testbeds of community detection algorithms. We have found, however, that a generative model, in which new edges are added via an iterative "forest fire" burning process, is able to produce graphs exhibiting a network community structure similar to our observations.

    :abstractText: This paper describes our work on the Download Estimation task for KDD Cup 2003. The task requires us to estimate how many times a paper has been downloaded in the first 60 days after it has been published on arXiv.org, a preprint server for papers on physics and related areas. The training data consists of approximately 29000 papers, the citation graph, and information about the downloads of a subset of these papers. Our approach is based on an extension of the bag-of-words model, with linear SVM regression as the learning algorithm. We describe our experiments with various kinds of features. We focus particularly on issues of feature construction and weighting, which turns out to be quite important for this task.

    :abstractText: Tracking new topics, ideas, and "memes" across the Web has been an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities. However, these approaches are less well suited to the identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs over a period of three months with the total of 90 million articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior around the overall peak and a "heartbeat"-like pattern in the handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a mathematical model for the kinds of temporal variation that the system exhibits.

    :abstractText: Emergence of the web and online computing applications gave rise to rich large scale social activity data. One of the principal challenges then is to build models and understanding of the structure of such large social and information networks. Here I present our work on clustering and community structure in large networks, where clusters are thought of as sets of nodes that are better connected internally than to the rest of the network. We find that large networks have very different clustering structure from well studied small social networks and graphs that are well-embeddable in a low-dimensional structure. In networks of millions of nodes tight clusters exist at only very small size scales up to around 100 nodes, while at large size scales networks becomes expander like. A network model based on Kronecker products efficiently models such core-periphery network structures. The results suggest broader implications for data analysis and machine learning in sparse and noisy high-dimensional social and information networks, where intuitive notions about cluster quality fail.

    :abstractText: Relations between users on social media sites often reflect a mixture of positive (friendly) and negative (antagonistic) interactions. In contrast to the bulk of research on social networks that has focused almost exclusively on positive interpretations of links between people, we study how the interplay between positive and negative relationships affects the structure of on-line social networks. We connect our analyses to theories of signed networks from social psychology. We find that the classical theory of structural balance tends to capture certain common patterns of interaction, but that it is also at odds with some of the fundamental phenomena we observe --- particularly related to the evolving, directed nature of these on-line networks. We then develop an alternate theory of status that better explains the observed edge signs and provides insights into the underlying social mechanisms. Our work provides one of the first large-scale evaluations of theories of signed networks using on-line datasets, as well as providing a perspective for reasoning about social media sites.

    :abstractText: The question of citation behavior has always intrigued scientists from various disciplines. While general citation patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper. We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and interdisciplinary forms.

    :abstractText: Information diffusion and virus propagation are fundamental processes talking place in networks. While it is often possible to directly observe when nodes become infected, observing individual transmissions (i.e., who infects whom or who influences whom) is typically very difficult. Furthermore, in many applications, the underlying network over which the diffusions and propagations spread is actually unobserved. We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate. Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected, we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and in practice gives provably near-optimal performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information cascades in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space. We find that the diffusion network of news tends to have a core-periphery structure with a small set of core media sites that diffuse information to the rest of the Web. These sites tend to have stable circles of influence with more general news media sites acting as connectors between them.

    :abstractText: We study online social networks in which relationships can be either positive (indicating relations such as friendship) or negative (indicating relations such as opposition or antagonism). Such a mix of positive and negative links arise in a variety of online settings; we study datasets from Epinions, Slashdot and Wikipedia. We find that the signs of links in the underlying social networks can be predicted with high accuracy, using models that generalize across this diverse range of sites. These models provide insight into some of the fundamental principles that drive the formation of signed links in networks, shedding light on theories of balance and status from social psychology; they also suggest social computing applications by which the attitude of one user toward another can be estimated from evidence provided by their relationships with other members of the surrounding social network.

    :abstractText: Detecting clusters or communities in large real-world graphs such as large social or information networks is a problem of considerable interest. In practice, one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity, and then one applies approximation algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the objective function and that "look like" good communities for the application of interest. In this paper, we explore a range of network community detection methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify. We evaluate several common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network community, and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms that aim to optimize such objective functions. In addition, rather than simply fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any size, we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem. Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer lens with which to examine community detection algorithms, since objective functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent behavior.

    :abstractText: The ability to update the structure of a Bayesian network when new data becomes available is crucial for building adaptive systems. Recent work by Sang, Beame, and Kautz (AAAI 2005) demonstrates that the well-known Davis-Putnam procedure combined with a dynamic decomposition and caching technique is an effective method for exact inference in Bayesian networks with high density and width. In this paper, we define dynamic model counting and extend the dynamic decomposition and caching technique to multiple runs on a series of problems with similar structure. This allows us to perform Bayesian inference incrementally as the structure of the network changes. Experimental results show that our approach yields significant improvements over the previous model counting approaches on multiple challenging Bayesian network instances.

    :abstractText: We present a model for buying agents in e-marketplaces to interpret evaluations of sellers provided by other buying agents, known as advisors. The interpretation of seller evaluations is complicated by the inherent subjectivity of each advisor, the possibility that advisors may deliberately provide misleading evaluations to deceive competitors and the dynamic nature of seller and advisor behaviours that may naturally change seller evaluations over time. Using a Bayesian approach, we demonstrate how to cope with subjectivity, deception and change in a principled way. More specifically, by modeling seller properties and advisor evaluation functions as dynamic random variables, buyers can progressively learn a probabilistic model that naturally and "correctly" calibrates the interpretation of seller evaluations without having to resort to heuristics to explicitely detect and filter/discount unreliable seller evaluations. Our model, called BLADE, is shown empirically to achieve lower mean error in the estimation of seller properties when compared to other models for reasoning about advisor ratings of sellers in electronic maketplaces.

    :abstractText: Previous studies have demonstrated that encoding a Bayesian network into a SAT-CNF formula and then performing weighted model counting using a backtracking search algorithm can be an effective method for exact inference in Bayesian networks. In this paper, we present techniques for improving this approach for Bayesian networks with noisy-OR and noisy-MAX relations-two relations which are widely used in practice as they can dramatically reduce the number of probabilities one needs to specify. In particular, we present two space efficient CNF encodings for noisy-OR/MAX and explore alternative search ordering heuristics. We experimentally evaluated our techniques on large-scale real and randomly generated Bayesian networks. On these benchmarks, our techniques gave speedups of up to two orders of magnitude over the best previous approaches and scaled up to networks with larger numbers of random variables.

    :abstractText: Reinforcement learning (RL) was originally proposed as a framework to allow agents to learn in an online fashion as they interact with their environment. Existing RL algorithms come short of achieving this goal because the amount of exploration required is often too costly and/or too time consuming for online learning. As a result, RL is mostly used for offline learning in simulated environments. We propose a new algorithm, called BEETLE, for effective online learning that is computationally efficient while minimizing the amount of exploration. We take a Bayesian model-based approach, framing RL as a partially observable Markov decision process. Our two main contributions are the analytical derivation that the optimal value function is the upper envelope of a set of multivariate polynomials, and an efficient point-based value iteration algorithm that exploits this simple parameterization.

    :abstractText: We describe methods to solve partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with continuous or large discrete observation spaces. Realistic problems often have rich observation spaces, posing significant problems for standard POMDP algorithms that require explicit enumeration of the observations. This problem is usually approached by imposing an a priori discretisation on the observation space, which can be sub-optimal for the decision making task. However, since only those observations that would change the policy need to be distinguished, the decision problem itself induces a lossless partitioning of the observation space. This paper demonstrates how to find this partition while computing a policy, and how the resulting discretisation of the observation space reveals the relevant features of the application domain. The algorithms are demonstrated on a toy example and on a realistic assisted living task.

    :abstractText: Collocation preferences represent the commonly used expressions, idioms, and word pairings of a language. Because collocation preferences arise from consensus usage, rather than a set of well-defined rules, they must be learned on a case-by-case basis, making them particularly challenging for non-native speakers of a language. To assist non-native speakers with these parts of a language, we developed AwkChecker, the first end-user tool geared toward helping non-native speakers detect and correct collocation errors in their writing. As a user writes, AwkChecker automatically flags collocation errors and suggests replacement expressions that correspond more closely to consensus usage. These suggestions include example usage to help users choose the best candidate. We describe AwkChecker's interface, its novel methods for detecting collocation errors and suggesting alternatives, and an early study of its use by non-native English speakers at our institution. Collectively, these contributions advance the state of the art in writing aids for non-native speakers.

    :abstractText: We propose a novel approach to optimize Partially Observable Markov Decisions Processes (POMDPs) defined on continuous spaces. To date, most algorithms for model-based POMDPs are restricted to discrete states, actions, and observations, but many real-world problems such as, for instance, robot navigation, are naturally defined on continuous spaces. In this work, we demonstrate that the value function for continuous POMDPs is convex in the beliefs over continuous state spaces, and piecewise-linear convex for the particular case of discrete observations and actions but still continuous states. We also demonstrate that continuous Bellman backups are contracting and isotonic ensuring the monotonic convergence of value-iteration algorithms. Relying on those properties, we extend the algorithm, originally developed for discrete POMDPs, to work in continuous state spaces by representing the observation, transition, and reward models using Gaussian mixtures, and the beliefs using Gaussian mixtures or particle sets. With these representations, the integrals that appear in the Bellman backup can be computed in closed form and, therefore, the algorithm is computationally feasible. Finally, we further extend to deal with continuous action and observation sets by designing effective sampling approaches.

    :abstractText: "Understanding the human gait is an important objective towards improving elderly mobility. In turn, gait analyses largely depend on kinematic and dynamic measurements. While the majority of current markerless vision systems focus on estimating 2D and 3D walking motion in the sagittal plane, we wish to estimate the 3D pose of rollator users' lower limbs from observing image sequences in the coronal (frontal) plane. Our apparatus poses a unique set of challenges: a single monocular view of only the lower limbs and a frontal perspective of the rollator user. Since motion in the coronal plane is relatively subtle, we explore multiple cues within a Bayesian probabilistic framework to formulate a posterior estimate for a given subject's leg limbs. This paper describes four cues based on three features to formulate a pose estimate: image gradients, colour and anthropometric symmetry. Our appearance model is applied within a non-parametric (particle) filtering system to track the lower limbs. Our tracking system does not rely on any detection for automatic initialization. Preliminary experiments are promising, showing that the algorithm may provide an indication of relative depth for each lower limb."

    :abstractText: This paper investigates the problem of automatically learning how to restructure the reward function of a Markov decision process so as to speed up reinforcement learning. We begin by describing a method that learns a shaped reward function given a set of state and temporal abstractions. Next, we consider decomposition of the per-timestep reward in multieffector problems, in which the overall agent can be decomposed into multiple units that are concurrently carrying out various tasks. We show by example that to find a good reward decomposition, it is often necessary to first shape the rewards appropriately. We then give a function approximation algorithm for solving both problems together. Standard reinforcement learning algorithms can be augmented with our methods, and we show experimentally that in each case, significantly faster learning results.

    :abstractText: We consider the online query auditing problem for statistical databases. Given a stream of aggregate queries posed over sensitive data, when should queries be denied in order to protect the privacy of individuals? We construct efficient auditors for max queries and bags of max and min queries in both the partial and full disclosure settings. Our algorithm for the partial disclosure setting involves a novel application of probabilistic inference techniques that may be of independent interest. We also study for the first time, a particular dimension of the utility of an auditing scheme and obtain initial results for the utility of sum auditing when guarding against full disclosure.The result is positive for large databases, indicating that answers to queries will not be riddled with denials.

    :abstractText: "We present an algorithm that derives actions' effects and preconditions in partially observable, relational domains. Our algorithm has two unique features: an expressive relational language, and an exact tractable computation. An action-schema language that we present permits learning of preconditions and effects that include implicit objects and unstated relationships between objects. For example, we can learn that replacing a blown fuse turns on all the lights whose switch is set to on. The algorithm maintains and outputs a relational-logical representation of all possible action-schema models after a sequence of executed actions and partial observations. Importantly, our algorithm takes polynomial time in the number of time steps and predicates. Time dependence on other domain parameters varies with the action-schema language. Our experiments show that the relational structure speeds up both learning and generalization, and outperforms propositional learning methods. It also allows establishing apriori-unknown connections between objects (e.g. light bulbs and their switches), and permits learning conditional effects in realistic and complex situations. Our algorithm takes advantage of a DAG structure that can be updated efficiently and preserves compactness of representation."

    :abstractText: We present tractable, exact algorithms for learning actions' effects and preconditions in partially observable domains. Our algorithms maintain a propositional logical representation of the set of possible action models after each observation and action execution. The algorithms perform exact learning of preconditions and effects in any deterministic action domain. This includes STRIPS actions and actions with conditional effects. In contrast, previous algorithms rely on approximations to achieve tractability, and do not supply approximation guarantees. Our algorithms take time and space that are polynomial in the number of domain features, and can maintain a representation that stays compact indefinitely. Our experimental results show that we can learn efficiently and practically in domains that contain over 1000's of features (more than 21000 states).

    :abstractText: Logical Filtering is the problem of tracking the possible states of a world (belief state) after a sequence of actions and observations. It is fundamental to applications in partially observable dynamic domains. This paper presents the first exact logical filtering algorithm that is tractable for all deterministic domains. Our tractability result is interesting because it contrasts sharply with intractability results for structured stochastic domains. The key to this advance lies in using logical circuits to represent belief states. We prove that both filtering time and representation size are linear in the sequence length and the input size. They are independent of the domain size if the actions have compact representations. The number of variables in the resulting formula is at most the number of state features. We also report on a reasoning algorithm (answering propositional questions) for our circuits, which can handle questions about past time steps (smoothing). We evaluate our algorithms extensively on AI planning domains. Our method outperforms competing methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude.

    :abstractText: In recent years, the blogosphere has experienced a substantial increase in the number of posts published daily, forcing users to cope with information overload. The task of guiding users through this flood of information has thus become critical. To address this issue, we present a principled approach for picking a set of posts that best covers the important stories in the blogosphere. We define a simple and elegant notion of coverage and formalize it as a submodular optimization problem, for which we can efficiently compute a near-optimal solution. In addition, since people have varied interests, the ideal coverage algorithm should incorporate user preferences in order to tailor the selected posts to individual tastes. We define the problem of learning a personalized coverage function by providing an appropriate user-interaction model and formalizing an online learning framework for this task. We then provide a no-regret algorithm which can quickly learn a user's preferences from limited feedback. We evaluate our coverage and personalization algorithms extensively over real blog data. Results from a user study show that our simple coverage algorithm does as well as most popular blog aggregation sites, including Google Blog Search, Yahoo! Buzz, and Digg. Furthermore, we demonstrate empirically that our algorithm can successfully adapt to user preferences. We believe that our technique, especially with personalization, can dramatically reduce information overload.

Traditionally, effort is applied only to problems that have already arrived and have been noted. We examine continual computation methods that allow agents to ideally allocate time to solving current as well as potential future problems under uncertainty. We first review prior work on continual computation. Then, we present new directions and results, including the consideration of shared subtasks and multiple tasks. We present results on the computational complexity of the continual-computation problem and provide approximations for arbitrary models of computational performance. Finally, we review special formulations for addressing uncertainty about the best algorithm to apply, learning about performance, and considering costs associated with delayed use of results.

    :abstractText: We propose random distributed multiresolution representations of sensor network data, so that the most significant encoding coefficients are easily accessible by querying a few sensors, anywhere in the network. Less significant encoding coefficients are available by querying a larger number of sensors, local to the region of interest. Significance can be defined in a multiresolution way, without any prior knowledge of the source data, as global summaries versus local details. Alternatively, significance can be defined in a data-adaptive way, as large differences between neighboring data values. We propose a distributed encoding algorithm that is robust to arbitrary wireless communication connectivity graphs, where links can fail or change with time. This randomized algorithm allows distributed computation that does not require strict global coordination or awareness of network connectivity at individual sensors. Because computations involve sensors in local neighborhoods of the communication graph, they are communication-efficient. Our framework uses local interaction among sensors to enable flexible information retrieval at the global level

The problem spans entire sectors, from scientists to intelligence analysts and web users, all of whom are constantly struggling to keep up with the larger and larger amounts of content published every day. With this much data, it is often easy to miss the big picture. In this paper, we investigate methods for automatically connecting the dots -- providing a structured, easy way to navigate within a new topic and discover hidden connections. We focus on the news domain: given two news articles, our system automatically finds a coherent chain linking them together. For example, it can recover the chain of events starting with the decline of home prices (January 2007), and ending with the ongoing health-care debate. We formalize the characteristics of a good chain and provide an efficient algorithm (with theoretical guarantees) to connect two fixed endpoints. We incorporate user feedback into our framework, allowing the stories to be refined and personalized. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm over real news data. Our user studies demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in helping users understanding the news."

    :abstractText: The Semantic Web is the next step of the current Web where information will become more machine-understandable to support effective data discovery and integration. Hierarchical schemas, either in the form of tree-like structures (e.g., DTDs, XML schemas), or in the form of hierarchies on a category/subcategory basis (e.g., thematic hierarchies of portal catalogs), play an important role in this task. They are used to enrich semantically the available information. Up to now, hierarchical schemas have been treated rather as sets of individual elements, acting as semantic guides for browsing or querying data. Under that view, queries like ''find the part of a portal catalog which is not present in another catalog'' can be answered only in a procedural way, specifying which nodes to select and how to get them. For this reason, we argue that hierarchical schemas should be treated as full-fledged objects so as to allow for their manipulation. This work proposes models and operators to manipulate the structural information of hierarchies, considering them as first-class citizens. First, we explore the algebraic properties of trees representing hierarchies, and define a lattice algebraic structure on them. Then, turning this structure into a boolean algebra, we present the operators S-union, S-intersection and S-difference to support structural manipulation of hierarchies. These operators have certain algebraic properties to provide clear semantics and assist the transformation, simplification and optimization of sequences of operations using laws similar to those of set theory. Also, we identify the conditions under which this framework is applicable. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our framework for manipulating hierarchical schemas on tree-like hierarchies encoded as RDF/s files.

    :abstractText: AI problems such as autonomous robotic exploration, automatic diagnosis and activity recognition have in common the need for choosing among a set of informative but possibly expensive observations. When monitoring spatial phenomena with sensor networks or mobile robots, for example, we need to decide which locations to observe in order to most effectively decrease the uncertainty, at minimum cost. These problems usually are NP-hard. Many observation selection objectives satisfy submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property - adding a sensor to a small deployment helps more than adding it to a large deployment. In this paper, we survey recent advances in systematically exploiting this submodularity property to efficiently achieve near-optimal observation selections, under complex constraints. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approaches on problems of monitoring environmental phenomena and water distribution networks.

Recent efforts have highlighted the potential to improve performance by personalizing services based on special knowledge about users. For example, a user's location, demographics, and search and browsing history may be useful in enhancing the results offered in response to web search queries. However, reasonable concerns about privacy by both users, providers, and government agencies acting on behalf of citizens, may limit access to such information. We introduce and explore an economics of privacy in personalization, where people can opt to share personal information in return for enhancements in the quality of an online service. We focus on the example of web search and formulate realistic objective functions for search efficacy and privacy. We demonstrate how we can identify a near-optimal solution to the utility-privacy tradeoff. We evaluate the methodology on data drawn from a log of the search activity of volunteer participants. We separately assess users' preferences about privacy and utility via a large-scale survey, aimed at eliciting preferences about peoples' willingness to trade the sharing of personal data in returns for gains in search efficiency. We show that a significant level of personalization can be achieved using only a small amount of information about users.

    :abstractText: When monitoring spatial phenomena, which are often modeled as Gaussian Processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. A common strategy is to place sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model. We propose a mutual information criteria, and show that it produces better placements. Furthermore, we prove that finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1 -- 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of our criterion. This algorithm is extended to handle local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on two real-world data sets.

    :abstractText: When monitoring spatial phenomena, such as the ecological condition of a river, deciding where to make observations is a challenging task. In these settings, a fundamental question is when an active learning, or sequential design, strategy, where locations are selected based on previous measurements, will perform significantly better than sensing at an a priori specified set of locations. For Gaussian Processes (GPs), which often accurately model spatial phenomena, we present an analysis and efficient algorithms that address this question. Central to our analysis is a theoretical bound which quantifies the performance difference between active and a priori design strategies. We consider GPs with unknown kernel parameters and present a nonmyopic approach for trading off exploration, i.e., decreasing uncertainty about the model parameters, and exploitation, i.e., near-optimally selecting observations when the parameters are (approximately) known. We discuss several exploration strategies, and present logarithmic sample complexity bounds for the exploration phase. We then extend our algorithm to handle nonstationary GPs exploiting local structure in the model. We also present extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world problems.

We find that after a short period of time the market will be dominated by a small number of cards, even though there do not exist significant differences between cards and the market is fully competitive. In contrast to the existing literature we focus on the dynamics of market shares and emergence of multi-homing rather than equilibrium outcomes.

    :abstractText: "Many real-world decision making tasks require us to choose among several expensive observations. In a sensor network, for example, it is important to select the subset of sensors that is expected to provide the strongest reduction in uncertainty. It has been general practice to use heuristic-guided procedures for selecting observations. In this paper, we present the first efficient optimal algorithms for selecting observations for a class of graphical models containing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We provide results for both selecting the optimal subset of observations, and for obtaining an optimal conditional observation plan. For both problems, we present algorithms for the filtering case, where only observations made in the past are taken into account, and the smoothing case, where all observations are utilized. Furthermore we prove a surprising result: In most graphical models tasks, if one designs an efficient algorithm for chain graphs, such as HMMs, this procedure can be generalized to polytrees. We prove that the value of information problem is NPPP-hard even for discrete polytrees. It also follows from our results that even computing conditional entropies, which are widely used to measure value of information, is a #P-complete problem on polytrees. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets."

    :abstractText: In many sensing applications, including environmental monitoring, measurement systems must cover a large space with only limited sensing resources. One approach to achieve required sensing coverage is to use robots to convey sensors within this space. Planning the motion of these robots - coordinating their paths in order to maximize the amount of information collected while placing bounds on their resources (e.g., path length or energy capacity) - is aNP-hard problem. In this paper, we present an efficient path planning algorithm that coordinates multiple robots, each having a resource constraint, to maximize the "informativeness" of their visited locations. In particular, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to characterize the amount of information collected. We provide strong theoretical approximation guarantees for our algorithm by exploiting the submodularity property of mutual information. In addition, we improve the efficiency of our approach by extending the algorithm using branch and bound and a region-based decomposition of the space. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of our algorithm, comparing with existing heuristics on datasets from several real world sensing applications.

This approach is well suited particularly for specificity evaluation of designed probes in large data sets. Algorithms for probe preselection, hybridization prediction and probe selection are presented. Combinatorial techniques are introduced for selecting probe sets of high differentiation capability even from conserved gene sequences, for instance automatic generation of group specific probes and excluding probes. A basic prototype was implemented including a shared memory parallelization and distribution. The principal applicability of our method to a database of very conserved sequence data was shown and the run-time performance estimated.

    :abstractText: "When monitoring spatial phenomena with wireless sensor networks, selecting the best sensor placements is a fundamental task. Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that optimizes the NP-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes (GPs)both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication cost of unsensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time, data-driven algorithm, pSPIEL, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations. Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality, under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our pSPIEL approach. We also provide extensive experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing methods."

    :abstractText: A great opportunity exists to fuse information from populations of privately-held sensors to create useful sensing applications. For example, GPS devices, embedded in cellphones and automobiles, might one day be employed as distributed networks of velocity sensors for traffic monitoring and routing. Unfortunately, privacy and resource considerations limit access to such data streams. We describe principles of community sensing that offer mechanisms for sharing data from privately held sensors. The methods take into account the likely availability of sensors, the context-sensitive value of sensor information, based on models of phenomena and demand, and sensor owners' preferences about privacy and resource usage. We present efficient and well-characterized approximations of optimal sensing policies. We provide details on key principles of community sensing and highlight their use within a case study for road traffic monitoring.

    :abstractText: Context-aware mobile computing requires wearable sensors to acquire information about the user. Continuous sensing rapidly depletes the wearable system's energy, which is a critically constrained resource. In this paper, we analyze the trade-off between power consumption and prediction accuracy of context classifiers working on dual-axis accelerometer data collected from the eWatch sensing and notification platform. We improve power consumption techniques by providing competitive classification performance even in the low frequency region of 1-10 Hz and for the highly erratic wrist based sensing location. Furthermore, we propose and analyze a collection of selective sampling strategies in order to reduce the number of required sensor readings and the computation cycles even further. Our results indicate that optimized sampling schemes can increase the deployment lifetime of a wearable computing platform by a factor of four without a significant loss in prediction accuracy.

    :abstractText: Increasing user comfort and reducing operation costs have always been two primary objectives of building operations and control strategies. Current building control strategies are unable to incorporate occupant level comfort and meet the operation goals simultaneously. In this paper, we present a novel utility-based building control strategy that optimizes the tradeoff between meeting user comfort and reduction in operation cost by reducing energy usage. We present an implementation of the proposed approach as an intelligent lighting control strategy that significantly reduces energy cost. Our approach is based on a principled, decision theoretic formulation of the control task. We demonstrate the use of mobile wireless sensor networks to optimize the trade-off between fulfilling different occupants' light preferences and minimizing energy consumption. We further extend our approach to optimally exploit external light sources for additional energy savings, a process called daylight harvesting. Also we demonstrate that an active sensing approach can maximize the mobile sensor network's lifetime by sensing only during most informative situations. We provide efficient algorithms for solving the underlying complex optimization problems, and extensively evaluate our proposed approach in a proof-of-concept testbed using MICA2 motes and dimmable lamps. Our results indicate a significant improvement in user utility and reduced energy expenditure.

    :abstractText: The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental applications, such as the water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes, motivates the use of robotic sensors in order to achieve sufficient spatial coverage. Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for near-optimally solving the NP-hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we first develop eSIP (efficient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using eSIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation, which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as eSIP, for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed infield for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.

    :abstractText: Shared services have proven to be a key element when it comes to increasing government efficiency by collaboration. Here, we seek to investigate into the shared services phenomenon in the context of government reforms. For this purpose, an interview and document analysis-based multiple case study has been conducted in Germany. The qualitative analysis covers two shared service implementations on the local government level and identifies important preconditions for shared service emergence, namely cost pressure as motive, the existence of key actors promoting the topic and the existence of prior cooperation. Moreover, it is shown that the structure of such previous cooperation determines, if shared services are being organised in a centralised (shared service centre) or decentralised format (shared service network).

    :abstractText: We introduce an agent-based model featuring near-zero-intelligence traders operating in a double auction market with a wide range of trading rules governing the determination of prices, which orders are executed as well as a range of parameters regarding market intervention by market makers and the presence of informed traders. We find that our model produces properties that are commonly found in financial markets and which are robust to the trading rules employed, only in some instances the observed properties deviate significantly. We can thus conclude that the properties of returns arising in double auction markets are not very sensitive to the trading rules employed.

    :abstractText: We propose a prediction model based on the minority game in which traders continuously evaluate a complete set of trading strategies with different memory lengths using the strategies' past performance. Based on the chosen trading strategy they determine their prediction of the movement for the following time period of a single asset. We find empirically using stocks from the S&P500 that our prediction model yields a high success rate of over 51.5% and produces higher returns than a buy-and-hold strategy. Even when taking into account trading costs we find that using the predictions will generate superior investment portfolios.

    :abstractText: Many robotic path planning applications, such as search and rescue, involve uncertain environments with complex dynamics that can be only partially observed. When selecting the best subset of observation locations subject to constrained resources (such as limited time or battery capacity) it is an important problem to trade off exploration (gathering information about the environment) and exploitation (using the current knowledge about the environment most effectively) for efficiently observing these environments. Even the nonadaptive setting, where paths are planned before observations are made, is NP-hard, and has been subject to much research. In this paper, we present a novel approach to adaptive informative path planning that addresses this exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Our approach is nonmyopic, i.e. it plans ahead for possible observations that can be made in the future. We quantify the benefit of exploration through the "adaptivity gap" between an adaptive and a nonadaptive algorithm in terms of the uncertainty in the environment. Exploiting the submodularity (a diminishing returns property) and locality properties of the objective function, we develop an algorithm that performs provably near-optimally in settings where the adaptivity gap is small. In case of large gap, we use an objective function that simultaneously optimizes paths for exploration and exploitation. We also provide an algorithm to extend any single robot algorithm for adaptive informative path planning to the multi robot setting while approximately preserving the theoretical guarantee of the single robot algorithm. We extensively evaluate our approach on a search and rescue domain and a scientific monitoring problem using a real robotic system.

    :abstractText: A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in order to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate prediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many applications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from data, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks solving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible, and thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present Distributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for repeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility of the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees that apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural diminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely low communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We extend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several real-world sensing tasks.

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of monitoring spatial phenomena, such as road speeds on a highway, using wireless sensors with limited battery life. A central question is to decide where to locate these sensors to best predict the phenomenon at the unsensed locations. However, given the power constraints, we also need to determine when to selectively activate these sensors in order to maximize the performance while satisfying lifetime requirements. Traditionally, these two problems of sensor placement and scheduling have been considered separately from each other; one first decides where to place the sensors, and then when to activate them. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm, ESPASS, that simultaneously optimizes the placement and the schedule. We prove that ESPASS provides a constant-factor approximation to the optimal solution of this NP-hard optimization problem. A salient feature of our approach is that it obtains \xE2\x80\x9Cbalanced\xE2\x80\x9D schedules that perform uniformly well over time, rather than only on average. We then extend the algorithm to allow for a smooth power-accuracy tradeoff. Our algorithm applies to complex settings where the sensing quality of a set of sensors is measured, e.g., in the improvement of prediction accuracy (more formally, to situations where the sensing quality function is submodular). We present extensive empirical studies on several sensing tasks, and our results show that simultaneously placing and scheduling gives drastically improved performance compared to separate placement and scheduling (e.g., a 33% improvement in network lifetime on the traffic prediction task)."

    :abstractText: "Many real-world decision making tasks require us to choose among several expensive observations. In a sensor network, for example, it is important to select the subset of sensors that is expected to provide the strongest reduction in uncertainty. In medical decision making tasks, one needs to select which tests to administer before deciding on the most effective treatment. It has been general practice to use heuristic-guided procedures for selecting observations. In this paper, we present the first efficient optimal algorithms for selecting observations for a class of probabilistic graphical models. For example, our algorithms allow to optimally label hidden variables in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We provide results for both selecting the optimal subset of observations, and for obtaining an optimal conditional observation plan. Furthermore we prove a surprising result: In most graphical models tasks, if one designs an efficient algorithm for chain graphs, such as HMMs, this procedure can be generalized to poly-tree graphical models. We prove that the optimizing value of information is NPPP-hard even for polytrees. It also follows from our results that just computing decision theoretic value of information objective functions, which are commonly used in practice, is a #P-complete problem even on Naive Bayes models (a simple special case of polytrees). In addition, we consider several extensions, such as using our algorithms for scheduling observation selection for multiple sensors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets, including a prototype sensor network deployment for energy conservation in buildings."

    :abstractText: When monitoring spatial phenomena, which can often be modeled as Gaussian processes (GPs), choosing sensor locations is a fundamental task. There are several common strategies to address this task, for example, geometry or disk models, placing sensors at the points of highest entropy (variance) in the GP model, and A-, D-, or E-optimal design. In this paper, we tackle the combinatorial optimization problem of maximizing the mutual information between the chosen locations and the locations which are not selected. We prove that the problem of finding the configuration that maximizes mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation that is within (1-1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of mutual information. We also show how submodularity can be used to obtain online bounds, and design branch and bound search procedures. We then extend our algorithm to exploit lazy evaluations and local structure in the GP, yielding significant speedups. We also extend our approach to find placements which are robust against node failures and uncertainties in the model. These extensions are again associated with rigorous theoretical approximation guarantees, exploiting the submodularity of the objective function. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach towards optimizing mutual information in a very extensive empirical study on two real-world data sets.

Similarly to convexity, submodularity allows one to efficiently find provably (near-) optimal solutions for large problems.

    :abstractText: Given observed data and a collection of parameterized candidate models, a 1 -- &alpha; confidence region in parameter space provides useful insight as to those models which are a good fit to the data, all while keeping the probability of incorrect exclusion below &alpha;. With complex models, optimally precise procedures (those with small expected size) are, in practice, difficult to derive; one solution is the Minimax Expected-Size (MES) confidence procedure. The key computational problem of MES is computing a minimax equilibria to a certain zero-sum game. We show that this game is convex with bilinear payoffs, allowing us to apply any convex game solver, including linear programming. Exploiting the sparsity of the matrix, along with using fast linear programming software, allows us to compute approximate minimax expected-size confidence regions orders of magnitude faster than previously published methods. We test these approaches by estimating parameters for a cosmological model.

    :abstractText: "We study a general online convex optimization problem. We have a convex set S and an unknown sequence of cost functions c1, c2,..., and in each period, we choose a feasible point xt in S, and learn the cost ct(xt). If the function ct is also revealed after each period then, as Zinkevich shows in [25], gradient descent can be used on these functions to get regret bounds of O(&radic;n). That is, after n rounds, the total cost incurred will be O(&radic;n) more than the cost of the best single feasible decision chosen with the benefit of hindsight, minx &Sigma; ct(x).We extend this to the \"bandit\" setting, where, in each period, only the cost ct(xt) is revealed, and bound the expected regret as O(n3/4).Our approach uses a simple approximation of the gradient that is computed from evaluating ct at a single (random) point. We show that this biased estimate is sufficient to approximate gradient descent on the sequence of functions. In other words, it is possible to use gradient descent without seeing anything more than the value of the functions at a single point. The guarantees hold even in the most general case: online against an adaptive adversary.For the online linear optimization problem [15], algorithms with low regrets in the bandit setting have recently been given against oblivious [1] and adaptive adversaries [19]. In contrast to these algorithms, which distinguish between explicit explore and exploit periods, our algorithm can be interpreted as doing a small amount of exploration in each period."

    :abstractText: We present two efficient algorithms constructing a spanning tree with minimum eccentricity of a source, for a given graph with weighted edges and a set of source vertices. The first algorithm is both simpler to implement and faster of the two. The second approach involves enumerating single-source shortest-path spanning trees for all points on a graph, a technique that may be useful in solving other problems.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents an event-driven approach that efficiently detects collisions among multiple moving spheres of uniform radius. We divide the space containing the spheres into uniform subspaces of cell structure. Each sphere intersecting a subspace is tested against the others intersecting the same subspace for possible collisions. We identify three types of events to detect the sequence of all collisions during our simulation: collision, entering, and leaving. The first type of events is due to actual collisions, and the other two types occur when spheres move from subspace to subspace. By tracing all such events in the order of their occuring times, we are able to simulate n moving spheres with proper collision response in O(n_c \\log n + n_e \\log n) time with O(n) space after O(n \\log n) time preprocessing, where n_c and n_e are the number of actual collisions and that of entering and leaving events during the simulation, respectively. Since n_e depends on the size of subspaces, we adopt the collision model from kinetic theory for molecular gas to determine the subspace size that minimizes simulation time. Experimental results show that collision detection can be done in linear time in n over a large range."

    :abstractText: We present anew technique to maintain a BSP for a set of n moving disj oint segments in the plane. Our kinetic BSP uses O(n log n) storage and it undergoes O(n 2 ) changes in the worst case, assuming that the endpoints of the segments move along bounded-degree algebraically dened trajecto- ries. The response time (the time needed to update the BSP when it undergoes a change) is O(log 2 n). A random- ized variant achieves O(log n) expected response time, while the worst-case response time remains O(log 2 n).The new BSP is based on a simple technique for main- taining a 1-d segment tree on a set of intervals on the real line with moving endpoints. The response time of the ki- netic segment treeisO(log n) intheworst case, and O(1) expected.

    :abstractText: We prove that, for any constant &egr;>0, the complexity of the vertical decomposition of a set of n triangles in three-dimensional space is O(n2+&egr;+K), where K is the complexity of the arrangement of the triangles. For a single cell the complexity of the vertical decomposition is shown to be O(n2+&egr;). These bounds are almost tight in the worst case. We also give a deterministic output-sensitive algorithm for computing the vertical decomposition that runs in O(n2logn+Vlogn) time, where V is the complexity of the decomposition. The algorithm is reasonably simple (in particular, it tries to perform as much of the computation in two-dimensional spaces as possible) and thus is a good candidate for efficient implementations.

    :abstractText: This video considers the problem of discovering the boundary S of an unknown smooth object O. The discovery process consists of moving a point probing device in the free space around O so that it repeatedly comes in contact with S. We present a probing strategy for generating a sequence of sample points of S, from which a PL-approximation of S can be constructed, within any desired accuracy. This strategy can be applied in any dimension, although its output is guaranteed only for objects embedded in the plane or in 3-space. For pedagogical purpose, the video focuses on the planar case.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of discovering a smooth unknown surface S bounding an object O in R3. The discovery process consists of moving a point probing device in the free space around O so that it repeatedly comes in contact with S. We propose a probing strategy for generating a sequence of surface samples on S from which a triangulated surface can be generated which approximates S within any desired accuracy. We bound the number of probes and the number of elementary moves of the probing device. Our solution is an extension of previous work on Delaunay refinement techniques for surface meshing. The approximating surface we generate enjoys the many nice properties of the meshes obtained by those techniques, e.g. exact topological type, normal approximation, etc.

    :abstractText: "We show that for any set &Pgr; of n points in three-dimensional space there is a set Q of &Ogr;(n1/2 log3 n) points so that the Delaunay triangulation of &Pgr; &cup; Q has at most &Ogr;(n3/2 log3 n) edges &mdash; even though the Delaunay triangulation of &Pgr; may have &OHgr;(n2) edges. The main tool of our construction is the following geometric covering result: For any set &Pgr; of n points in three-dimensional space and any set S of m spheres, where each sphere passes through a distinct point pair in &Pgr;, there exists a point x, not necessarily in &Pgr;, that is enclosed by &OHgr;(m2/n2 log3 n2/m) of the spheres in S.par>Our results generalize to arbitrary fixed dimensions, to geometric bodies other than spheres, and to geometric structures other than Delaunay triangulations."

    :abstractText: We apply Megiddo's parametric searching technique to several geometric optimization problems and derive significantly improve solutions for them. We obtain, for any fixed &egr; > 0, an O(n1+&egr;) algorithm for computing the diameter of a point set in 3-space, an O(n8/5+&egr;) algorithm for computing the closest pair in a set of n lines in space. All these algorithms are deterministic. We also look at the problem of computing the k-th smallest slope formed by the lines joining n points in the plane. In 1989 Cole, Salowe, Steiger, and Szemere&acute;di gave an optimal but very complicated O(n log n) solution based on Megiddo's technique. We follow a different route and give a very simple O(n log2 n) solution which bypasses parametric searching altogether.

    :abstractText: We show that the total number of edges of m faces of an arrangement of n lines in the plane is &Ogr;(m2/3-&dgr; n2/3+2&dgr; + n), for any &dgr; > 0. The proof takes an algorithmic approach, that is, we describe an algorithm for the calculation of these m faces and derive the upper bound from the analysis of the algorithm. The algorithm uses randomization and, with high probability, its time complexity is within a log2n factor of the above bound. If instead of lines we have an arrangement of n line segments, then the maximum number of edges of m faces is Ogr;(m2/3-&dgr;n2/3+2&dgr; + n&agr;(n)logm), for any &dgr; > 0, where &agr;(n) is the functional inverse of Ackermann's function. We give a (randomized) algorithm that produces these faces and, with high probability, takes time that is within a log2n factor of the combinatorial bound.

    :abstractText: \emph{We propose a new randomized algorithm for maintaining a set of c lusters among moving nodes in the plane. Given a specified cluster radius, our algorithm selects and maintains a variable subset of the nodes as cluster centers. This subset has the property that (1) balls of the given radius centered at the chosen nodes cover all the others and (2) the number of centers selected is a constant-factor approximation of the minimum possible. As the nodes move, an event-based kinetic data structure updates the clustering as necessary. This kinetic data structure is shown to be responsive, efficient, local, and compact. The produced cover is also smooth, in the sense that wholesale cluster re-arrangements are avoided. The algorithm can be implemented without exact knowledge of the node positions, if each node is able to sense its distance to other nodes up to the cluster radius. Such a kinetic clustering can be used in numerous applications where mobile devices must be interconnected into an ad-hoc network to collaboratively perform some task.}

    :abstractText: "For a set S of points in &Ropf;3, an s-spanner is a graph on S such that any pair of points is connected via some path in the spanner whose total length is at most s times the Euclidean distance between the points. In this paper we propose a new sparse (1+\xCE\xB5)-spanner with O(n/\xCE\xB5d) edges, where \xCE\xB5 is a specified parameter. The key property of this spanner is that it can be efficiently maintained under dynamic insertion or deletion ofpoints, as well as under continuous motion of the points in both the kinetic data structures setting and in the more realistic blackbox displacement model we introduce. Our deformable spanner succinctly encodes all proximity information in a deforming point cloud, giving us efficient kinetic algorithms for problems such as the closest pair, the near neighbors of all points, approximate nearest neighbor search (aka approximate Voronoi diagram), well-separated pair decomposition, and approximate k-centers."

This paper shows how to preprocess the polygon so that, given two query points p and q inside P, the length of the shortest path inside the polygon from p to q can be found in time &Ogr;(log n). The path itself must be polygonal and can be extracted in additional time proportional to the number of turns it makes. The preprocessing consists of triangulation plus a linear amount of additional work.

We assume that our two initial polygons have the same number of sides n, and that corresponding sides are parallel. We show that a morph is always possible by a varying simple interpolating polygon also of n sides parallel to those of the two original ones. If we consider a uniform scaling or translation of part of the polygon as an atomic morphing step, then we show that O(n4/3+&egr;) such steps are sufficient for the morph.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose to study deformable necklaces --- flexible chains of balls, called beads, in which only adjacent balls may intersect. Such objects can be used to model macro-molecules, muscles, rope, and other 'linear' objects in the physical world. In this paper, we exploit this linearity to develop geometric structures associated with necklaces that are useful in physical simulations. We show how these structures can be implemented efficiently and maintained under necklace deformation. In particular, we study a bounding volume hierarchy based on spheres built on a necklace. Such a hierarchy is easy to compute and is suitable for maintenance when the necklace deforms, as our theoretical and experimental results show. This hierarchy can be used for collision and self-collision detection. In particular, we achieve an upper bound of O(nlog n) in two dimensions and O(n 2-2/d) in d-dimensions, d 3, for collision checking. To our knowledge, this is the first sub-quadratic bound proved for a collision detection algorithm using predefined hierarchies. In addition, we show that the power diagram, with the help of some additional mechanisms, can be also used to detect self-collisions of a necklace in certain ways complementary to the sphere hierarchy.

    :abstractText: The computation of Delaunay triangulations from static point sets has been extensively studied in computational geometry. When the points move with known trajectories, kinetic data structures can be used to maintain the triangulation. However, there has been little work so far on how to maintain the triangulation when the points move without explicit motion plans, as in the case of a physical simulation. In this paper we examine how to update Delaunay triangulations after small displacements of the defining points, as might be provided by a physics-based integrator. We have implemented a variety of update algorithms, many new, toward this purpose. We ran these algorithms on a corpus of data sets to provide running time comparisons and determined that updating Delaunay can be significantly faster than recomputing.

Our convolution algorithms rely on new optimal solutions for certain reciprocal search problems, such as finding intersections between &ldquo;blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;green&rdquo; intervals, and overlaying convex planar subdivisions.

    :abstractText: We show that, under reasonable assumptions, any collision-avoiding motion planning problem for a moving system with two degrees of freedom can be solved in time &Ogr;(&lgr;s(n) log2n), where n is the number of collision constraints imposed on the system, s is a fixed parameter depending e.g. on the maximum algebraic degree of these constraints, and &lgr;s(n) is the (almost linear) maximum length of (n,s) Davenport Schinzel sequences. This follows from an upper bound of &Ogr;(&lgr;s(n)) that we establish for the combinatorial complexity of a single connected component of the space of all free placements of the moving system. Although our study is motivated by motion planning, it is actually a study of topological, combinatorial, and algorithmic issues involving a single face in an arrangement of curves. Our results thus extend beyond the area of motion planning, and have applications in many other areas.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents an event-driven approach that efficiently detects collisions among multiple ballistic spheres moving in the 3D space. Adopting a hierarchical uniform space subdivision scheme, we are able to trace the trajectories of spheres and their time-varying spatial distribution. We identify three types of events to detect the sequence of all collisions during our simulation: collision, entering, and leaving. The first type of events is due to actual collisions, and the other two types occur when spheres move from subspace to subspace in the space. Tracing all such events in the order of their occurring times, we are able to avoid fixed time step simulation. When the size of the largest sphere is bounded by a constant multiple of that of the smallest, it takes $O\\left( {\\bar n_c\\ \\log\\ n+\\overline n_e\\ \\log\\ n} \\right)$ time with O(n) space after O(n log n) time preprocessing to simulate n moving spheres, where $\\overline n_c$ and $\\overline n_e$ are the number of actual collisions and that of entering and leaving events during the simulation, respectively. Since $\\overline n_e$ depends on the size of subspaces, we modify the collision model from kinetic theory for molecular gas to determine the subspace sizes for the space subdivision scheme, that minimize simulation time. Experimental results show that collision detection can be done in linear time in n over a large range."

    :abstractText: It is a well-established fact that the witness complex is closelyrelated to the restricted Delaunay triangulation in lowdimensions. Specifically, it has been proved that the witness complexcoincides with the restricted Delaunay triangulation on curves, and isstill a subset of it on surfaces, under mild samplingassumptions. Unfortunately, these results do not extend tohigher-dimensional manifolds, even under stronger samplingconditions. In this paper, we show how the sets of witnesses andlandmarks can be enriched, so that the nice relations that existbetween both complexes still hold on higher-dimensional manifolds. Wealso use our structural results to devise an algorithm thatreconstructs manifolds of any arbitrary dimension or co-dimension atdifferent scales. The algorithm combines a farthest-point refinementscheme with a vertex pumping strategy. It is very simple conceptually,and it does not require the input point sample W to be sparse. Itstime complexity is bounded by c(d) |W|2, where c(d) is a constantdepending solely on the dimension d of the ambient space.

    :abstractText: The problem we address in this paper is how to detect an intruder moving through a polygonal space that is equipped with a camera sensor network. We propose a probabilistic sensor tasking algorithm in which cameras sense the environment independently of one another, thus reducing the communication overhead. Since constant monitoring is prohibitively expensive with complex sensors such as cameras, the amount of sensing done is also minimized. To be effective, a minimum detection probability must be guaranteed by the system over all possible paths through the space. The straightforward approach of enumerating all such paths is intractable, since there is generally an infinite number of potential paths. Using a geometric decomposition of the space, we lowerbound the detection probability over all paths using a small number of linear constraints. The camera tasking is computed for set of example layouts and shows large performance gains with our probabilistic scheme over both constant monitoring as well as over a deterministic heuristic.

    :abstractText: We consider the parametric minimum spanning tree problem, in which we are given a graph with edge weights that are linear functions of a parameter $\lambda$ and wish to compute the sequence of minimum spanning trees generated as $\lambda$ varies. We also consider the kinetic minimum spanning tree problem, in which $\lambda$ represents time and the graph is subject in addition to changes such as edge insertions, deletions, and modifications of the weight functions as time progresses. We solve both problems in time $O(n^{2/3}\log^{4/3}n)$ per combinatorial change in the tree (or randomized $O(n^{2/3}\log n)$ per change). Our time bounds reduce to $O(n^{1/2}\log^{3/2} n)$ per change ($O(n^{1/2}\log n)$ randomized) for planar graphs or other minor-closed families of graphs, and $O(n^{1/4}\log^{3/2} n)$ per change ($O(n^{1/4}\log n)$ randomized) for planar graphs with weight changes but no insertions or deletions.

    :abstractText: Consider a collection of disjoint polygons in the plane containing a total of n edges. We show how to build, in O(n2) time and space, a data structure from which in O(n) time we can compute the visibility polygon of a given point with respect to the polygon collection. As an application of this structure, the visibility graph of the given polygons can be constructed in O(n2) time and space. This implies that the shortest path that connects two points in the plane and avoids the polygons in our collection can be computed in O(n2) time, improving earlier O(n2 log n) results.

    :abstractText: "This paper uses a new formulation of the notion of duality that allows the unified treatment of a number of geometric problems. In particular, we are able to apply our approach to solve two long-standing problems of computational geometry: one is to obtain a quadratic algorithm for computing the minimum-area triangle with vertices chosen among n points in the plane; the other is to produce an optimal algorithm for the half-plane range query problem. This problem is to preprocess n points in the plane, so that given a test half-plane, one can efficiently determine all points lying in the half-plane. We describe an optimal O(k + log n) time algorithm for answering such queries, where k is the number of points to be reported. The algorithm requires O(n) space and O(n log n) preprocessing time. Both of these results represent significant improvements over the best methods previously known. In addition, we give a number of new combinatorial results related to the computation of line arrangements."

They also extend the analysis to three dimensions, where they concentrate on the case of spheres, which is relevant for the three-dimensional unit-distance problem. They obtain upper bounds for certain quantities. The authors believe that the techniques they use are of independent interest.

The first area concerns the development and demonstration of a sensor data compression algorithm and its application to the detection of structural damage. The second area concerns the prediction in near real-time of the transient dynamics of a structural system using a nonlinear reduced-order model and a time-parallel ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) solver.

    :abstractText: The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is a distance measure between distributions with applications in image retrieval and matching. We consider the problem of computing a transformation of one distribution which minimizes its EMD to another.The applications discussed here include estimation of the size at which a color pattern occurs in an image, lighting-invariant object recognition, and point feature matching in stereo image pairs. We present a monotonically convergent iteration which can be applied to a large class of EMD under transformation problems, although the iteration may converge to only a locally optimal transformation. We also provide algorithms that are guaranteed to compute a globally optimal transformation for a few specific problems, including some EMD under translation problems.

    :abstractText: We introduce a new distance between two distributions that we call the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which reflects the minimal amount of work that must be performed to transform one distribution into the other by moving "distribution mass" around. This is a special case of the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available. The EMD also allows for partial matching. When used to compare distributions thathave the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric, and has easy-to-compute lower bounds. In this paper we focus on applications to image databases, especially color and texture. We use the EMD to exhibit the structure of color-distribution and texture spaces by means of Multi-Dimensional Scaling displays. We also propose a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a collection of color images, which leads to a new paradigm for image database search.

    :abstractText: Estimating the number of people in a crowded environment is a central task in civilian surveillance. Most vision-based counting techniques depend on detecting individuals in order to count, an unrealistic proposition in crowded settings. We propose an alternative approach that directly estimates the number of people. In our system, groups of image sensors segment foreground objects from the background, aggregate the resulting silhouettes over a network, and compute a planar projection of the scene's visual hull. We introduce a geometric algorithm that calculates bounds on the number of persons in each region of the projection, after phantom regions have been eliminated. The computational requirements scale well with the number of sensors and the number of people, and only limited amounts of data are transmitted over the network. Because of these properties, our system runs in real-time and can be deployed as an untethered wireless sensor network. We describe the major components of our system, and report preliminary experiments with our first prototype implementation.

    :abstractText: "This paper studies task assignment in a network of resource constrained computing platforms (called microservers). A task is an abstraction of a computational agent or data that is hosted by the microservers. For example, in an object tracking scenario, a task represents a mobile tracking agent, such as a vehicle location update computation, that runs on microservers, which can receive sensor data pertaining to the object of interest. Due to object motion, the microservers that can observe a particular object change over time and there is overhead involved in migrating tasks among microservers. Furthermore, communication, processing, or memory constraints, allow a microserver to only serve a limited number of objects at the same time. Our overall goal is to assign tasks to microservers so as to minimize the number of migrations, and thus be kinetically stable, while guaranteeing that as many tasks as possible are monitored at all times. When the task trajectories are known in advance, we show that this problem is NP-complete (even over just two time steps), has an integrality gap of at least 2, and can be solved optimally in polynomial time if we allow tasks to be assigned fractionally. When only probabilistic information about future movement of the tasks is known, we propose two algorithms: a multi-commodity flow based algorithm and a maximum matching algorithm. We use simulations to compare the performance of these algorithms against the optimum task allocation strategy."

    :abstractText: We address the problem of distributed information aggregation and storage in a sensor network, where queries can be injected anywhere in the network. The principle we propose is that a sensor should know a "fraction" of the information from distant parts of the network, in an exponentially decaying fashion by distance. We show how a sampled scalar field can be stored in this distributed fashion, with only a modest amount of additional storage and network traffic. Our storage scheme makes neighboring sensors have highly correlated world views; this allows smooth information gradients and enables local search algorithms to work well. We study in particular how this principle of fractionally cascaded information can be exploited to answer range queries about the sampled field efficiently. Using local decisions only we are able to route the query to exactly the portions of the field where the sought information is stored. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that our scheme is close to optimal.

    :abstractText: We present a methodology for a sensor network to answer queries with limited and stochastic information using probabilistic techniques. This capability is useful in that it allows sensor networks to answer queries effectively even when present information is partially corrupt and when more information is unavailable or too costly to obtain. We use a Bayesian network to model the sensor network and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference. We demonstrate our technique on the specific problem of determining whether a friendly agent is surrounded by enemy agents and present simulation results for it.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a new group communication scheme, roamingcast, for collaborative information processing in wireless sensor networks. Roamingcast enables efficient communication among a subset of mobile terminals in a collaboration group. Unicast and multicast communication can be considered as special cases of roamingcast in which the subset contains one and all group members, respectively. We propose a Roaming Hub Based Architecture (RoamHBA, pronounced as 'rumba') as one solution to support roaming-cast. We present the distributed construction and dynamic update of a multicast tree, referred as the roaming hub. This roaming hub has the property that an average pair of terminals communicate using the hub with only constant degradation in path length compared to the best possible path. We have developed network layer protocols implementing this mechanism and evaluated their performance in comparison with roaming restricted flooding. We simulated our design using NS-2.

    :abstractText: This paper describes a sensor network approach to tracking a single object in the presence of static and moving occluders using a network of cameras. To conserve communication bandwidth and energy, each camera first performs simple local processing to reduce each frame to a scan line. This information is then sent to a cluster head to track a point object. We assume the locations of the static occluders to be known, but only prior statistics on the positions of the moving occluders are available. A noisy perspective camera measurement model is presented, where occlusions are captured through an occlusion indicator function. An auxiliary particle filter that incorporates the occluder information is used to track the object. Using simulations, we investigate (i) the dependency of the tracker performance on the accuracy of the moving occluder priors, (ii) the tradeoff between the number of cameras and the occluder prior accuracy required to achieve a prescribed tracker performance, and (iii) the importance of having occluder priors to the tracker performance as the number of occluders increases. We generally find that computing moving occluder priors may not be worthwhile, unless it can be obtained cheaply and to a reasonable accuracy. Preliminary experimental results are provided.

    :abstractText: We study the problem of aggregating data from a sparse set of nodes in a wireless sensor network. This is a common situation when a sensor network is deployed to detect relatively rare events. In such situations, each node that should participate in the aggregation knows this fact based on its own sensor readings, but there is no global knowledge in the network of where all these interesting nodes are located. Instead of blindly querying all nodes in the network, we show how the interesting nodes can autonomously discover each other in a distributed fashion and form an ad hoc aggregation structure that can be used to compute cumulants, moments, or other statistical summaries. Key to our approach is the capability for two nodes that wish to communicate at roughly the same time to discover each other at a cost that is proportional to their network distance. We show how to build nearly optimal aggregation structures that can further deal with network volatility and compensate for the loss or duplication of data by exploiting probabilistic techniques.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a scalable distributed algorithm for computing and maintaining multi-target identity information. The algorithm builds on a novel representational framework, Identity-Mass Flow, to overcome the problem of exponential computational complexity in managing multi-target identity explicitly. The algorithm uses local information to efficiently update the global multi-target identity information represented as a doubly stochastic matrix, and can be efficiently mapped to nodes in a wireless ad hoc sensor network. The paper describes a distributed implementation of the algorithm in sensor networks. Simulation results have validated the Identity-Mass Flow framework and demonstrated the feasibility of the algorithm.

    :abstractText: Maintaining the identities of moving objects is an important aspect of most multi-object tracking applications. Uncertainty in sensor data, coupled with the intrinsic combinatorial difficulty of the data association problem, suggests probabilistic formulations over the set of possible identities. While an explicit representation of a distribution over all associations may require exponential storage and computation, in practice the information provided by this distribution is accessed only in certain stylized ways, as when asking for the identity of a given track, or the track with a given identity. Exploiting this observation, we proposed in [1] a practical solution to this problem based on maintaining marginal probabilities and demonstrated its effectiveness in the context of tracking within a wireless sensor network. That method, unfortunately, requires extensive communication in the network whenever new identity observations are made, in order for normalization operations to keep the marginals consistent [2]. In this paper, we have proposed a very different solution based on accumulated log-likelihoods that can postpone all normalization computations until actual identity queries are made. In this manner the continuous communication and computational expense of repeated normalizations is avoided and that effort is expended only when actual queries are made of the network. We compare the two methods in terms of their computational complexities, inference accuracies, and distributed implementations. Simulation and experimental results from a RFID system are also presented.

    :abstractText: "We present a robust approach to data collection, aggregation, and dissemination problems in sensor networks. Our method is based on the idea of a sweep over the network: a wavefront that traverses the network, passes over each node exactly once, and performs the desired operation(s). We do not require global information about the sensor field such as node locations. Instead, in a preprocessing phase, we compute a potential function over the network whose gradients guide the sweep process. The sweep itself operates asynchronously, using only local operations to advance the wavefront. The gradient information provides a local ordering of the nodes that helps reduce the number of MAC-layer collisions as the wavefront advances, while also globally shaping the wavefront so as to conform to the sensor field layout. The approach is robust to both link volatility and node failures that may be present in real network conditions. The potential is computed by a stable diffusion process in which each node repeatedly set its potential to the average of the potentials of its neighbors. Aggregation paths are decided on-line as the sweep proceeds and no fixed tree structure is needed over the course of the computation. We present simulation results illustrating the correctness of the algorithm and comparing the performance of the sweep to aggregation trees under various network conditions."

    :abstractText: In sensor networks we aim to achieve global objectives through local decisions at each node, based only on data available in the node's neighborhood. In this paper, we diffuse information away from source nodes holding desired data, so as to establish information potentials that allow network queries to navigate towards and reach these sources through local greedy decisions, following information gradients. We compute these information potentials by solving for a discrete approximation to a partial differential equation over appropriate network neighborhoods, through a simple local iteration that can be executed in a distributed manner and can be re-invoked to repair the information field locally when links fail, sources move, etc. The solutions to this equation are classical harmonic functions, which have a rich algebraic structure and many useful properties, including the absence of local extrema, providing a guarantee that our local greedy navigation will not get stuck.Unlike shortest path trees, which can also be used to guide queries to sources, information potentials are robust to low-level link volatility as they reflect more global properties of the underlying connectivity. By exploiting the algebraic structure of harmonic functions such potentials can be combined in interesting ways to enable far greater path diversity and thus provide better load balancing than is possible with fixed tree structures, or they can be used to answer range queries about the number of sources in a certain regions by simply traversing the boundary of the region. Potentials for multiple information types can be aggregated and compressed using a variant of the q-digest data structure. The paper provides both analytic results and detailed simulations supporting these claims.

    :abstractText: Wireless ad hoc sensor networks have the advantage of spanning a large geographical region and being able to collaboratively detect and track non-local spatio-temporal events. This paper presents a dual-space approach to event tracking and sensor resource management in sensor networks. The dual-space transformation maps a non-local phenomenon, e.g., the edge of a half-plane shadow, to a single point in the dual space, and maps locations of distributed sensor nodes to a set of lines that partitions the dual space. The detection problem becomes finding and tracking the cell that contains the point in the arrangement defined by these lines. This mechanism can be effectively used for power management of the sensor network - nodes that will not be immediately visited by an event can be turned off to save energy required for sensing, processing, and communication. The approach has been successfully demonstrated on a laboratory testbed built using the UC Berkeley motes sensors. An implemented application of detecting and tracking light shadow edges moving over a sensor field is described.

    :abstractText: Mobility in networks arises both as mobility of packets and mobility of nodes. In a wireless setting, packets move under network control to meet desiderata of low latency, high throughput, load-balancing, energy conservation, etc. Nodes, though, often move under the influence of forces unrelated to the network state, necessitating the continuous adaptation of supporting network structures. In order to understand how to best design such structures, it is important to study the stability of various network mechanisms under node motion, as well as under other kinds of variability in the network, such as wireless link volatility. Since networks are embedded in the physical world (sometimes in order to monitor this very world, as in sensor networks) and node motion happens under physical laws, geometric and topological methods can be useful in understanding global structures that can affect network performance. In this talk we give a number of examples of such methods, such as the use of kinetic data structures in clustering mobile nodes and the use of topological complexes for capturing the global structure of a static network with the goal of designing efficient routing protocols.

    :abstractText: We present an algorithm enabling localization of moving wireless devices in an indoor setting. The method uses only RF signal strength and can be implemented without specialized hardware. The mobility of the users is modeled by learning a function mapping a short history of signal strength values to a 2D position. We use radial basis function (RBF) fitting to learn a reliable estimate of a mobile node's position given its past signal strength measurements. Even though we deal with extremely noisy measurements in a cluttered indoor setting, nodes are not required to be stationary during measurement or learning. We evaluate our algorithm in a real indoor setting using MicaZ motes, achieving an average localization accuracy of 1.3 m. In our experiments, using historical data improves the localization accuracy by almost a factor of two compared to using only the most current measurements.

    :abstractText: The development of lightweight sensing andcommunication protocols is a key requirement for designing resource constrained sensor networks. This paper introduces a set of efficient protocols and algorithms, DAM, EBAM, and EMLAM, for constructing and maintaining sensor aggregates that collectively monitor target activity in the environment. A sensor aggregate comprises those nodes in a network that satisfy a grouping predicate for a collaborative processing task. The parameters of the predicate depend on the task and its resource requirements. Since the foremost purpose of a sensor network is to selectively gather information about the environment, the formation of appropriate sensor aggregates is crucial for optimally allocating resources to sensing and communication tasks.This paper makes minimal assumptions about node onboard processing and communication capabilities so as to allow possible implementations on resource-constrained hardware. Factors affecting protocol performance are discussed. The paper presents simulation results showing how the protocol performance varies as key network and task parameters are varied. It also provides probabilistic analyses of network behavior consistent with the simulation results. The protocols have been experimentally validated on a sensor network testbed comprising 25 Berkeley MICA sensor motes.

Combined with a node clustering algorithm RDG can be used as an underlying graph for geographic routing protocols. This graph has the following attractive properties: (1) it is a planar graph; (2) between any two nodes there exists a path in the RDG whose length, whether measured in terms of topological or Euclidean distance, is only a constant times the optimum length possible; and (3) the graph can be maintained efficiently in a distributed manner when the nodes move around. Furthermore, each node only needs constant time to make routing decisions. We also show by simulation that the RDG outperforms the previously proposed routing graphs under the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) protocol. In addition, we investigate theoretical bounds on the quality of paths discovered using GPSR"

    :abstractText: "Most existing APL implementations are interpretive in nature, that is, each time an APL statement is encountered it is executed by a body of code that is perfectly general, i.e. capable of evaluating any APL expression, and is in no way tailored to the statement on hand. This costly generality is said to be justified because APL variables are typeless and thus can vary arbitrarily in type, shape, and size during the execution of a program. What this argument overlooks is that the operational semantics of an APL statement are not modified by the varying storage requirements of its variables. The first proposal for a non fully interpretive implementation was the thesis of P. Abrams [1], in which a high level interpreter can defer performing certain operations by compiling code which a low level interpreter must later be called upon to execute. The benefit thus gained is that intelligence gathered from a wider context can be brought to bear on the evaluation of a subexpression. Thus on evaluating (A+B)[I], only the addition A[I]+B[I] will be performed. More recently, A. Perlis and several of his students at Yale [9,10] have presented a scheme by which a full-fledged APL compiler can be written. The compiled code generated can then be very efficiently executed on a specialized hardware processor. A similar scheme is used in the newly released HP/3000 APL [12]. This paper builds on and extends the above ideas in several directions. We start by studying in some depth the two key notions all this work has in common, namely compilation and delayed evaluation in the context of APL. By delayed evaluation we mean the strategy of deferring the computation of intermediate results until the moment they are needed. Thus large intermediate expressions are not built in storage; instead their elements are \"streamed\" in time. Delayed evaluation for APL was probably first proposed by Barton (see [8]). Many APL operators do not correspond to any real data operations. Instead their effect is to rename the elements of the array they act upon. A wide class of such operators, which we will call the grid selectors, can be handled by essentially pushing them down the expression tree and incorporating their effect into the leaf accessors. Semantically this is equivalent to the drag-along transformations described by Abrams. Performing this optimization will be shown to be an integral part of delayed evaluation. In order to focus our attention on the above issues, we make a number of simplifying assumptions. We confine our attention to code compilation for single APL expressions, such as might occur in an \"APL Calculator\", where user defined functions are not allowed. Of course we will be critically concerned with the re-usability of the compiled code for future evaluations. We also ignore the distinctions among the various APL primitive types and assume that all our arrays are of one uniform numeric type. We have studied the situation without these simplifying assumptions, but plan to report on this elsewhere. The following is a list of the main contributions of this paper. \" We present an algorithm for incorporating the selector operators into the accessors for the leaves of the expression tree. The algorithm runs in time proportional to the size of the tree, as opposed to its path length (which is the case for the algorithms of [10] and [12]). Although arbitrary reshapes cannot be handled by the above algorithm, an especially important case can: that of a conforming reshape. The reshape A&ntilde;B is called conforming if &ntilde;B is a suffix of A. \" By using conforming reshapes we can eliminate inner and outer products from the expression tree and replace them with scalar operators and reductions along the last dimension. We do this by introducing appropriate selectors on the product arguments, then eventually absorbing these selectors into the leaf accessors. The same mechanism handles scalar extension, the convention of making scalar operands of scalar operators conform to arbitrary arrays. \" Once products, scalar extensions, and selectors have been eliminated, what is left is an expression tree consisting entirely of scalar operators and reductions along the last dimension. As a consequence, during execution, the dimension currently being worked on obeys a strict stack-like discipline. This implies that we can generate extremely efficient code that is independent of the ranks of the arguments. Several APL operators use the elements of their operands several times. A pure delayed evaluation strategy would require multiple reevaluations. \" We introduce a general buffering mechanism, called slicing, which allows portions of a subexpression that will be repeatedly needed to be saved, to avoid future recomputation. Slicing is well integrated with the evaluation on demand mechanism. For example, when operators that break the streaming are encountered, slicing is used to determine the minimum size buffer required between the order in which a subexpression can deliver its result, and the order in which the full expression needs it. \" The compiled code is very efficient. A minimal number of loop variables is maintained and accessors are shared among as many expression atoms as possible. Finally, the code generated is well suited for execution by an ordinary minicomputer, such as a PDP-11, or a Data General Nova. We have implemented this compiler on the Alto computer at Xerox PARC. The plan of the paper is this: We start with a general discussion of compilation and delayed evaluation. Then we motivate the structures and algorithms we need to introduce by showing how to handle a wider and wider class of the primitive APL operators. We discuss various ways of tailoring an evaluator for a particular expression. Some of this tailoring is possible based only on the expression itself, while other optimizations require knowledge of the (sizes of) the atom bindings in the expression. The reader should always be alert to the kind of knowledge being used, for this affects the validity of the compiled code across reexecutions of a statement."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we initiate a study of shape description and classification via the application of persistent homology to two tangential constructions on geometric objects. Our techniques combine the differentiating power of geometry with the classifying power of topology. The homology of our first construction, the tangent complex, can distinguish between topologically identical shapes with different "sharp" features, such as corners. To capture "soft" curvature-dependent features, we define a second complex, the filtered tangent complex, obtained by parametrizing a family of increasing subcomplexes of the tangent complex. Applying persistent homology, we obtain a shape descriptor, called a barcode, that is a finite union of intervals. We define a metric over the space of such intervals, arriving at a continuous invariant that reflects the geometric properties of shapes. We illustrate the power of our methods through a number of detailed studies of parametrized families of mathematical shapes.

    :abstractText: "We propose a method for segmentation of 3D scanned shapes into simple geometric parts. Given an input point cloud, our method computes a set of components which possess one or more slippable motions: rigid motions which, when applied to a shape, slide the transformed version against the stationary version without forming any gaps. Slippable shapes include rotationally and translationally symmetrical shapes such as planes, spheres, and cylinders, which are often found as components of scanned mechanical parts. We show how to determine the slippable motions of a given shape by computing eigenvalues of a certain symmetric matrix derived from the points and normals of the shape. Our algorithm then discovers slippable components in the input data by computing local slippage signatures at a set of points of the input and iteratively aggregating regions with matching slippable motions. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm for reverse engineering surfaces of mechanical parts."

    :abstractText: We present an algorithm for the automatic alignment of two 3D shapes (data and model), without any assumptions about their initial positions. The algorithm computes for each surface point a descriptor based on local geometry that is robust to noise. A small number of feature points are automatically picked from the data shape according to the uniqueness of the descriptor value at the point. For each feature point on the data, we use the descriptor values of the model to find potential corresponding points. We then develop a fast branch-and-bound algorithm based on distance matrix comparisons to select the optimal correspondence set and bring the two shapes into a coarse alignment. The result of our alignment algorithm is used as the initialization to ICP (iterative closest point) and its variants for fine registration of the data to the model. Our algorithm can be used for matching shapes that overlap only over parts of their extent, for building models from partial range scans, as well as for simple symmetry detection, and for matching shapes undergoing articulated motion.

    :abstractText: We propose an algorithm that performs registration of large sets of unstructured point clouds of moving and deforming objects without computing correspondences. Given as input a set of frames with dense spatial and temporal sampling, such as the raw output of a fast scanner, our algorithm exploits the underlying temporal coherence in the data to directly compute the motion of the scanned object and bring all frames into a common coordinate system. In contrast with existing methods which usually perform pairwise alignments between consecutive frames, our algorithm computes a globally consistent motion spanning multiple frames. We add a time coordinate to all the input points based on the ordering of the respective frames and pose the problem of computing the motion of each frame as an estimation of certain kinematic properties of the resulting space-time surface. By performing this estimation for each frame as a whole we are able to compute rigid inter-frame motions, and by adapting our method to perform a local analysis of the space-time surface, we extend the basic algorithm to handle registration of deformable objects as well. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a number of synthetic and scanned examples, each consisting of hundreds of scans.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we describe a system for the reconstruction of deforming geometry from a time sequence of unstructured, noisy point clouds, as produced by recent real-time range scanning devices. Our technique reconstructs both the geometry and dense correspondences over time. Using the correspondences, holes due to occlusion are filled in from other frames. Our reconstruction technique is based on a statistical framework: The reconstruction should both match the measured data points and maximize prior probability densities that prefer smoothness, rigid deformation and smooth movements over time. The optimization procedure consists of an inner loop that optimizes the 4D shape using continuous numerical optimization and an outer loop that infers the discrete 4D topology of the data set using an iterative model assembly algorithm. We apply the technique to a variety of data sets, demonstrating that the new approach is capable of robustly retrieving animated models with correspondences from data sets suffering from significant noise, outliers and acquisition holes."

    :abstractText: We propose a new probabilistic framework for the efficient estimation of similarity between 3D shapes. Our framework is based on local shape signatures and is designed to allow for quick pruning of dissimilar shapes, while guaranteeing not to miss any shape with significant similarities to the query model in shape database retrieval applications. Since directly evaluating 3D similarity for large collections of signatures on shapes is expensive and impractical, we propose a suitable but compact approximation based on probabilistic fingerprints which are computed from the shape signatures using Rabin's hashing scheme and a small set of random permutations. We provide a probabilistic analysis that shows that while the preprocessing time depends on the complexity of the model, the fingerprint size and hence the query time depends only on the desired confidence in our estimated similarity. Our method is robust to noise, invariant to rigid transforms, handles articulated deformations, and effectively detects partial matches. In addition, it provides important hints about correspondences across shapes which can then significantly benefit other algorithms that explicitly align the models. We demonstrate the utility of our method on a wide variety of geometry processing applications.

    :abstractText: We propose a framework for pairwise registration of shapes represented by point cloud data (PCD). We assume that the points are sampled from a surface and formulate the problem of aligning two PCDs as a minimization of the squared distance between the underlying surfaces. Local quadratic approximants of the squared distance function are used to develop a linear system whose solution gives the best aligning rigid transform for the given pair of point clouds. The rigid transform is applied and the linear system corresponding to the new orientation is build. This process is iterated until it converges. The point-to-point and the point-to-plane Iterated Closest Point (ICP) algorithms can be treated as special cases in this framework. Our algorithm can align PCDs even when they are placed far apart, and is experimentally found to be more stable than point-to-plane ICP. We analyze the convergence behavior of our algorithm and of point-to-point and point-to-plane ICP under our proposed framework, and derive bounds on their rate of convergence. We compare the stability and convergence properties of our algorithm with other registration algorithms on a variety of scanned data.

    :abstractText: We present a novel approach for obtaining a complete and consistent 3D model representation from incomplete surface scans, using a database of 3D shapes to provide geometric priors for regions of missing data. Our method retrieves suitable context models from the database, warps the retrieved models to conform with the input data, and consistently blends the warped models to obtain the final consolidated 3D shape. We define a shape matching penalty function and corresponding optimization scheme for computing the non-rigid alignment of the context models with the input data. This allows a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the quality of the shape extrapolation provided by each model. Our algorithms are explicitly designed to accommodate uncertain data and can thus be applied directly to raw scanner output. We show on a variety of real data sets how consistent models can be obtained from highly incomplete input. The information gained during the shape completion process can be utilized for future scans, thus continuously simplifying the creation of complex 3D models.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of converting boundary representations of polyhedral objects into constructive-solid-geometry (CSG) representations. The CSG representations for a polyhedron P are based on the half-spaces supporting the faces of P. For certain kinds of polyhedra this problem is equivalent to the corresponding problem for simple polygons in the plane. We give a new proof that the interior of each simple polygon can be represented by a monotone boolean formula based on the half-planes supporting the sides of the polygon and using each such half-plane only once. Our main contribution is an efficient and practical O(n log n) algorithm for doing this boundary-to-CSG conversion for a simple polygon of n sides. We also prove that such nice formul&aelig; do not always exist for general polyhedra in three dimensions.

    :abstractText: Given two non-intersecting simple polylines in the plane, we study the problem of continuously transforming or morphing one polyline into the other. Our morphing strategies have the desirable property that every intermediate polyline is also simple. We also guarantee that no portion of the polylines to be morphed is stretched or compressed by more than a user-defined parameter during the entire morphing. Our algorithms are based on the morphing width, a new metric we have developed for measuring the similarity between two polylines. We develop an algorithm that computes the morphing width of the two polylines and constructs a corresponding morphing strategy in &Ogr;(n2 log2 n) time using &Ogr;(n2) space, where n is the total number of vertices in the polylines. We describe another algorithm that computes a factor-2 approximation of the morphing width and a corresponding morphing scheme in &Ogr;(n log n) time.

    :abstractText: "We consider the following problem: given a simple polygon P and a star-shaped polygon V, find a point (or the set of points) in P from which the portion of P that is visible is congruent to V. The problem arises in the localization of robots using a range-finder&mdash;P is a map of a known environment, V is the portion visible from the robot's position, and the robot must use this information to determine its position in the map. We give a scheme that preprocesses P so that any subsequent query V is answered in optimal time O(m + log n + A), where m and n are the number of vertices in V and P, and A is the number of points in P that are valid answers (the output size). Our technique allows us to trade off smoothly between the query time and the preprocessing time or space. We also devise a data structure for output-sensitive determination of the visibility polygon of a query point inside a polygon P. We then consider a variant of the localization problem in which there is a maximum distance to which the robot can &ldquo;see&rdquo;&mdash;this is motivated by practical considerations, and we outline a similar solution for this case. We also show that a single localization query V can be answered in time O(mn) with no preprocessing."

In this paper we propose to use zonotopes as bounding volumes for geometry in collision detection and other applications where the spatial relationship between two pieces of geometry is important. We show how to construct optimal, or approximately optimal zonotopes enclosing given set of points or other geometry. We also show how zonotopes can be used for efficient collision testing, based on their representation via their defining line segments --- without ever building their explicit description as polytopes. This implicit representation adds flexibility, power, and economy to the use of zonotopes as bounding volumes."

    :abstractText: It is well known that the Delaunay Triangulation is a spanner graph of its vertices. In this paper we show that any bounded aspect ratio triangulation in two and three dimensions is a spanner graph of its vertices as well. We extend the notion of spanner graphs to environments with obstacles and show that both the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation and bounded aspect ratio conforming triangulations are spanners with respect to the corresponding visibility graph. We also show how to kinetize the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation. Using such time-varying triangulations we describe how to maintain sets of near neighbors for a set of moving points in both unconstrained and constrained environments. Such nearest neighbor maintenance is needed in many virtual environments where nearby agents interact. Finally, we show how to use the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation in order to maintain the relative convex hull of a set of points moving inside a simple polygon.

    :abstractText: "We present a novel reconstruction algorithm that, given an input point set sampled from an object S, builds a one-parameter family of complexes that approximate S at different scales. At a high level, our method is very similar in spirit to Chew's surface meshing algorithm, with one notable difference: the restricted Delaunay triangulation is replaced by the witness complex, which makes our algorithm applicable in any metric space. To prove its correctness on curves and surfaces, we highlight the relationship between the witness complex and the restricted Delaunay triangulation in 2d and in 3d. Specifically, we prove that both complexes are equal in 2d and closely related in 3d, under some mild sampling assumptions."

    :abstractText: We introduce a novel feature size for bounded planar domains endowed with an intrinsic metric. Given a point x in such a domain X, the homotopy feature size of X at x, or hfs(x) for short, measures half the length of the shortest loop through x that is not null-homotopic in X. The resort to an intrinsic metric makes hfs(x) rather insensitive to the local geometry of X, in contrast with its predecessors (local feature size, weak feature size, homology feature size). This leads to a reduced number of samples that still capture the topology of X. Under reasonable sampling conditions involving hfs, we show that the geodesic Delaunay traingulation DX (L) of a finite sampling L of X is homotopy equivalent to X. Moreover, DX (L) is sandwiched between the geodesic witness complex CWX (L) and a relaxed version CWX, v (L), defined by a parameter v. Taking advantage of this fact, we prove that the homology of DX (L) (and hence of X) can be retrieved by computing the persistent homology between CWX (L) and CWX, v (L). We propose algorithms for estimating hfs, selecting a landmark set of sufficient density, building its geodesic Delaunay triangulation, and computing the homology of X using CWX (L). We also present some simulation results in the context of sensor networks that corroborate our theoretical statements.

    :abstractText: Given a real-valued function f defined over some metric space X, is it possible to recover some structural information about f from the sole information of its values at a finite set L &sube; X of sample points, whose pairwise distances in X are given? We provide a positive answer to this question. More precisely, taking advantage of recent advances on the front of stability for persistence diagrams, we introduce a novel algebraic construction, based on a pair of nested families of simplicial complexes built on top of the point cloud L, from which the persistence diagram of f can be faithfully approximated. We derive from this construction a series of algorithms for the analysis of scalar fields from point cloud data. These algorithms are simple and easy to implement, have reasonable complexities, and come with theoretical guarantees. To illustrate the generality of the approach, we present some experimental results obtained in various applications, ranging from clustering to sensor networks (see the electronic version of the paper for color pictures).

Using this algorithm, we show that the Voronoi diagram of n points in the plane can be computed in &THgr;(n) time when these points form the vertices of a convex polygon in, say, counterclockwise order. This settles an outstanding open problem in computational geometry. Our techniques can also be used to obtain linear time algorithms for computing the farthest-point Voronoi diagram and the medial axis of a convex polygon and for deleting a vertex from a general planar Voronoi diagram.

    :abstractText: We present a new data structure for maintaining a set of records in a linear list according to their key values. This data structure has the property that we can keep a number of fingers at points of interest in the key space (e.g., the beginning or the end of the list), so that access and modification in the neighborhood of a finger is very efficient. In the Section 2 we discuss the general structure of our B-tree. Since we propose to search the tree from a leaf upwards, additional links need to be introduced. In Section 3 we show how to obtain our result for the case of one finger. A key idea is the construction of a number representation behaving as described above, which we can use to model the propagation of modifications in the B-tree along the finger path. In Section 4 we generalize the structure so that several fingers in the key space can be maintained, with the advantage that access is cheap in the neighborhood of each finger. Finally in Section 5 we present some implementation notes and applications, mostly to sorting.

    :abstractText: In this paper we analyze the performance of a well known algorithm known as double hashing [Knuth]. In this method we probe the hash table along arithmetic progressions, where both the initial element and the increment of the progression are chosen randomly and independently depending only on the key K of the search. We prove that double hashing is asymptotically equivalent to uniform probing, an idealized hashing technique that exhibits no clustering and is known to be optimal in a certain sense. Between steps of the extension process we can show that the effect of clustering is negligible, and that we therefore never depart too far from the truly random situation.

    :abstractText: "We discuss the following problem: given n points in the plane (the &ldquo;sites&rdquo;), and an arbitrary query point q, find the site that is closest to q. This problem can be solved by constructing the Voronoi diagram of the given sites, and then locating the query point in one of its regions. We give two algorithms, one that constructs the Voronoi diagram in O(n lg n) time, and another that inserts a new site in O(n) time. Both are based on the use of the Voronoi dual, the Delaunay triangulation, and are simple enough to be of practical value. The simplicity of both algorithms can be attributed to the separation of the geometrical and topological aspects of the problem, and to the use of two simple but powerful primitives, a geometric predicate and an operator for manipulating the topology of the diagram. The topology is represented by a new data structure for generalized diagrams, that is embeddings of graphs in two-dimensional manifolds. This structure represents simultaneously an embedding, its dual, and its mirror-image. Furthermore, just two operators are sufficient for building and modifying arbitrary diagrams."

    :abstractText: Given a collection of disjoint objects in the plane, we are interested in translating them by a common vector. If we have a primitive for translating one object at a time, then the order in which the objects can individually be translated is often geometrically constrained. In this paper we study the nature of these constraints and exhibit optimal algorithms for finding valid motion ordering for several different classes of objects. These algorithms find use in computer display applications.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of determining the maximum and minimum elements {x_{1}, \ldots ,x_{n}}$, drawn from some finite universe $\cal U$ of real numbers, using only unary predicates of the inputs. It is shown that $\Theta (n + \log |{\cal U} |) $ unary predicate evaluations are necessary and sufficient, in the worst case. Results are applied to i) the problem of determining approximate extrema of a set of real numbers, in the same model, and ii) the multiparty broadcast communication complexity of determining the extrema of an arbitrary set of numbers held by distinct processors.

    :abstractText: Collision detection is critical for applications that demand a great deal of spatial interaction among objects. In such applications the trajectory of an object is often not known in advance either since a user is allowed to move an object at his/her will, or since an object moves under the rules that are hard to describe by exact mathematical formulas. In this paper we present a new algorithm that efficiently detects the collisions among moving spheres with unknown trajectories. We assume that the current position and velocity of every sphere can be probed at any time although its trajectory is unknown. We also assume that the magnitude of the acceleration of each sphere is bounded. Under these assumptions, we represent the bounding volume of the sphere as a moving sphere of variable radius, called a time-varying bound. Whenever the time-varying bounds of two spheres collide with each other, they are checked for actual collision. Exploiting these bounds, the previous event-driven approach for detecting the collisions among multiple moving spheres with ballistic trajectories is generalized for those with unknown trajectories. The proposed algorithm shows an interactive performance for thousands of moving spheres with unknown trajectories without any hardware help.

    :abstractText: In this paper we study a particular type of surface segmentation problem motivated by molecular biology applications. In particular, two input surfaces are given, coarsely modeling two different conformations of a molecule undergoing a semi-rigid deformation. The molecule consists of two subunits that move in a roughly rigid manner. The goal is to segment the input surfaces into these semi-rigid subcomponents. The problem is closely related to non-rigid surface registration problems, although considering only a special type of deformation that exists commonly in macromolecular movements (such as the popular hinge motion). We present and implement an efficient paradigm for this problem, which combines several existing and new ideas. We demonstrate the performance of our new algorithm by some preliminary experimental results in segmenting low-resolution molecular surfaces.

    :abstractText: Distance-dependent, pairwise, statistical potentials are based on the concept that the packing observed in known protein structures can be used as a reference for comparing different 3D models for a protein. Here, packing refers to the set of all pairs of atoms in the molecule. Among all methods developed to assess three-dimensional models, statistical potentials are subject both to praise for their power of discrimination, and to criticism for the weaknesses of their theoretical foundations. Classical derivations of pairwise potentials assume statistical independence of all pairs of atoms. This assumption, however, is not valid in general. We show that we can filter the list of all interactions in a protein to generate a much smaller subset of pairs that retains most of the structural information contained in proteins. The filter is based on a geometric method called alpha shapes that captures the packing in a conformation. Statistical scoring functions derived from such subsets perform as well as scoring functions derived from the set of all pairwise interactions.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present a complete computational pipeline for extracting a compact shape descriptor for curve point cloud data (PCD). Our shape descriptor, called a barcode, is based on a blend of techniques from differential geometry and algebraic topology. We also provide a metric over the space of barcodes, enabling fast comparison of PCDs for shape recognition and clustering. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implement our pipeline and provide experimental evidence in shape classification and parametrization.

    :abstractText: We present a robust and efficient algorithm for the pairwise non-rigid registration of partially overlapping 3D surfaces. Our approach treats non-rigid registration as an optimization problem and solves it by alternating between correspondence and deformation optimization. Assuming approximately isometric deformations, robust correspondences are generated using a pruning mechanism based on geodesic consistency. We iteratively learn an appropriate deformation discretization from the current set of correspondences and use it to update the correspondences in the next iteration. Our algorithm is able to register partially similar point clouds that undergo large deformations, in just a few seconds. We demonstrate the potential of our algorithm in various applications such as example based articulated segmentation, and shape interpolation.

    :abstractText: Although considerable attention in recent years has been given to the problem of symmetry detection in general shapes, few methods have been developed that aim to detect and quantify the intrinsic symmetry of a shape rather than its extrinsic, or pose-dependent symmetry. In this paper, we present a novel approach for efficiently computing symmetries of a shape which are invariant up to isometry preserving transformations. We show that the intrinsic symmetries of a shape are transformed into the Euclidean symmetries in the signature space defined by the eigen-functions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Based on this observation, we devise an algorithm which detects and computes the isometric mappings from the shape onto itself. We show that our approach is both computationally efficient and robust with respect to small non-isometric deformations, even if they include topological changes.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we propose to study deformable necklaces--flexible chains of balls, called beads, in which only adjacent balls may intersect. Such objects can be used to model macro-molecules, muscles, ropes, and other linear objects in the physical world. We exploit this linearity to develop geometric structures associated with necklaces that are useful for collision detection in physical simulations. We show how these structures can be implemented efficiently and maintained under necklace deformation. In particular, we study a bounding volume hierarchy based on spheres which can be used for collision and self-collision detection of deforming and moving necklaces. As our theoretical and experimental results show, such a hierarchy is easy to compute and, more importantly, is also easy to maintain when the necklace deforms. Using this hierarchy, we achieve a collision detection upper bound of O(n log n) in two dimensions and O(n2-2/d) in d-dimensions, d \xE2\x89\xA5 3. To our knowledge, this is the first subquadratic bound proved for a collision detection algorithm using predefined hierarchies. In addition, we show that the power diagram, with the help of some additional mechanisms, can be used to detect self-collisions of a necklace in a way that is complementary to the sphere hierarchy."

In order to do so, we create a planar subdivision of the free space between the two polygons, called the external relative geodesic triangulation, which certifies their disjointness. We show how this subdivision can be maintained as a kinetic data structure when the polygons are moving, and analyze its performance in the kinetic setting.

    :abstractText: For a set S of points in R^d, an s-spanner is a subgraph of the complete graph with node set S such that any pair of points is connected via some path in the spanner whose total length is at most s times the Euclidean distance between the points. In this paper we propose a new sparse (1+@e)-spanner with O(n/@e^d) edges, where @e is a specified parameter. The key property of this spanner is that it can be efficiently maintained under dynamic insertion or deletion of points, as well as under continuous motion of the points in both the kinetic data structures setting and in the more realistic blackbox displacement model we introduce. Our deformable spanner succinctly encodes all proximity information in a deforming point cloud, giving us efficient kinetic algorithms for problems such as the closest pair, the near neighbors of all points, approximate nearest neighbor search (aka approximate Voronoi diagram), well-separated pair decompositions, and approximate k-centers.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of discovering a smooth unknown surface S bounding an object O in R^3. The discovery process consists of moving a point probing device in the free space around O so that it repeatedly comes in contact with S. We propose a probing strategy for generating a sequence of surface samples on S from which a triangulated surface can be generated that approximates S within any desired accuracy. We bound the number of probes and the number of elementary moves of the probing device. Our solution is an extension of previous work on Delaunay refinement techniques for surface meshing. The approximating surface we generate enjoys the many nice properties of the meshes obtained by those techniques, e.g. exact topological type, normal approximation, etc.

    :abstractText: In this paper we present a package for implementing exact kinetic data structures built on objects which move along polynomial trajectories. We discuss how the package design was influenced by various considerations, including extensibility, support for multiple kinetic data structures, access to existing data structures and algorithms in CGAL, as well as debugging. Due to the similarity between the operations involved, the software can also be used to compute arrangements of polynomial objects using a sweepline approach. The package consists of three main parts, the kinetic data structure framework support code, an algebraic kernel which implements the set of algebraic operations required for kinetic data structure processing, and kinetic data structures for Delaunay triangulations in one and two dimensions, and Delaunay and regular triangulations in three dimensions. The models provided for the algebraic kernel support both exact operations and inexact approximations with heuristics to improve numerical stability.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of incrementally rendering a polyhedral scene while the viewpoint is moving. In practical situations the number of geometric primitives to be rendered can be as large as many millions. It is sometimes advantageous to render only the silhouettes of the objects, rather than the objects themselves. Such an approach is regularly used for example in the domain of non-photorealistic rendering, where the rendering of silhouette edges plays a key role. The difficult part in efficiently implementing a kinetic approach to this problem is to realize when the rendered silhouette undergoes a combinatorial change. In this paper, we obtain bounds on several problems involving the number of these events for a collection of k objects, with a total of n edges. We assume that our objects are convex polytopes, and that the viewpoint is moving along a straight line, or along an algebraic curve of bounded low degree. We also study the special case when the scene is a polyhedral terrain, and present improved bounds for this case. In addition to bounding the number events, we also obtain algorithms that compute all the changes occurring during a linear motion both for general scenes and for terrains.

    :abstractText: We develop new data structures for solving various visibility and intersection problems about a simple polygon P on n vertices. Among our results are a simple &Ogr;(n log n) algorithm for computing the illuminated subpolygon of P from a luminous side, and an &Ogr;(log n) algorithm for determining which side of P is first hit by a bullet fired from a point in a certain direction. The latter method requires preprocessing on P which takes time &Ogr;(n log n) and space &Ogr;(n). Our main new tool in attacking these problems is geometric duality on the two-sided plane.

    :abstractText: "We present a novel reconstruction algorithm that, given an input point set sampled from an object&#x00a0;S, builds a one-parameter family of complexes that approximate S at different scales. At a high level, our method is very similar in spirit to Chew&#x2019;s surface meshing algorithm, with one notable difference though: the restricted Delaunay triangulation is replaced by the witness complex, which makes our algorithm applicable in any metric space. To prove its correctness on curves and surfaces, we highlight the relationship between the witness complex and the restricted Delaunay triangulation in 2d and in&#x00a0;3d. Specifically, we prove that both complexes are equal in 2d and closely related in&#x00a0;3d, under some mild sampling assumptions."

    :abstractText: We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval. The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances.

    :abstractText: In real sensor network deployments, spatial distributions of sensors are usually far from being uniform. Such networks often contain regions without enough sensor nodes, which we call holes. In this paper, we show that holes are important topological features that need to be studied. In routing, holes are communication voids that cause greedy forwarding to fail. Holes can also be defined to denote regions of interest, such as the "hot spots" created by traffic congestion or sensor power shortage. In this paper, we define holes to be the regions enclosed by a polygonal cycle which contains all the nodes where local minima can appear. We also propose simple and distributed algorithms, the TENT rule and BOUNDHOLE, to identify and build routes around holes. We show that the boundaries of holes marked using BOUNDHOLE can be used in many applications such as geographic routing, path migration, information storage mechanisms and identification of regions of interest.

    :abstractText: "Let A and B be two convex polytopes in R3 with m and n facets, respectively. The penetration depth of A and B, denoted as \xCF\x80(A, B), is the minimum distance by which A has to be translated so that A and B do not intersect. We present a randomized algorithm that computes \xCF\x80(A, B) in O(m3/4+\xCE\xB5 n3/4+\xCE\xB5 +m1+\xCE\xB5 + n1+\xCE\xB5) expected time, for any constant \xCE\xB5 > 0. It also computes a vector t such that \xC2\xB6t\xC2\xB6 = \xCF\x80(A, B) and int(A + t) \xE2\x88\xA9 B = \xCE\xB8. We show that if the Minkowski sum B \xE2\x8A\x95 (-A) has K facets, then the expected running time of our algorithm is O (K1/2+\xCE\xB5 m1/4 n1/4 + m1+\xCE\xB5 + n1+\xCE\xB5), for any \xCE\xB5 > 0.We also present an approximation algorithm for computing \xCF\x80(A, B). For any \xCE\xB4 > 0, we can compute, in time O(m + n + (log2 (m + n))/\xCE\xB4), a vector t such that \xC2\xB6t\xC2\xB6 \xE2\x89\xA4 (1 + \xCE\xB4)\xCF\x80(A, B) and int(A + t) \xE2\x88\xA9 B = \xCE\xB8. Our result also gives a \xCE\xB4-approximation algorithm for computing the width of A in time O(n + (1/\xCE\xB4) log2(1/\xCE\xB4)), which is simpler and faster than the recent algorithm by Chan [3]."

Similar results apply in arbitrary fixed dimensions, and for geometric bodies other than spheres. The results have applications in reducing the size of geometric structures, such as three-dimensional Delaunay triangulations and Gabriel graphs, by adding extra points to their defining sets."

    :abstractText: "We consider the following problem: given a simple polygon ${\\cal P}$ and a star-shaped polygon ${\\cal V}$, find a point (or the set of points) in ${\\cal P}$ from which the portion of ${\\cal P}$ that is visible is translation-congruent to ${\\cal V}$. The problem arises in the localization of robots equipped with a range finder and a compass---${\\cal P}$ is a map of a known environment, ${\\cal V}$ is the portion visible from the robot's position, and the robot must use this information to determine its position in the map. We give a scheme that preprocesses ${\\cal P}$ so that any subsequent query ${\\cal V}$ is answered in optimal time O(m + log n + A), where m and n are the number of vertices in ${\\cal V}$ and ${\\cal P}$ and A is the number of points in ${\\cal P}$ that are valid answers (the output size). Our technique uses O(n5) space and preprocessing in the worst case; within certain limits, we can trade off smoothly between the query time and the preprocessing time and space. In the process of solving this problem, we also devise a data structure for output-sensitive determination of the visibility polygon of a query point inside a polygon ${\\cal P}$. We then consider a variant of the localization problem in which there is a maximum distance to which the robot can \"see\"---this is motivated by practical considerations, and we outline a similar solution for this case. We finally show that a single localization query ${\\cal V}$ can be answered in time O(mn) with no preprocessing."

    :abstractText: "\"Symmetry is a complexity-reducing concept [...]; seek it every-where.\" - Alan J. PerlisMany natural and man-made objects exhibit significant symmetries or contain repeated substructures. This paper presents a new algorithm that processes geometric models and efficiently discovers and extracts a compact representation of their Euclidean symmetries. These symmetries can be partial, approximate, or both. The method is based on matching simple local shape signatures in pairs and using these matches to accumulate evidence for symmetries in an appropriate transformation space. A clustering stage extracts potential significant symmetries of the object, followed by a verification step. Based on a statistical sampling analysis, we provide theoretical guarantees on the success rate of our algorithm. The extracted symmetry graph representation captures important high-level information about the structure of a geometric model which in turn enables a large set of further processing operations, including shape compression, segmentation, consistent editing, symmetrization, indexing for retrieval, etc."

    :abstractText: We present a new meshless animation framework for elastic and plastic materials that fracture. Central to our method is a highly dynamic surface and volume sampling method that supports arbitrary crack initiation, propagation, and termination, while avoiding many of the stability problems of traditional mesh-based techniques. We explicitly model advancing crack fronts and associated fracture surfaces embedded in the simulation volume. When cutting through the material, crack fronts directly affect the coupling between simulation nodes, requiring a dynamic adaptation of the nodal shape functions. We show how local visibility tests and dynamic caching lead to an efficient implementation of these effects based on point collocation. Complex fracture patterns of interacting and branching cracks are handled using a small set of topological operations for splitting, merging, and terminating crack fronts. This allows continuous propagation of cracks with highly detailed fracture surfaces, independent of the spatial resolution of the simulation nodes, and provides effective mechanisms for controlling fracture paths. We demonstrate our method for a wide range of materials, from stiff elastic to highly plastic objects that exhibit brittle and/or ductile fracture.

    :abstractText: We present a symmetrization algorithm for geometric objects. Our algorithm enhances approximate symmetries of a model while minimally altering its shape. Symmetrizing deformations are formulated as an optimization process that couples the spatial domain with a transformation configuration space, where symmetries can be expressed more naturally and compactly as parametrized point-pair mappings. We derive closed-form solution for the optimal symmetry transformations, given a set of corresponding sample pairs. The resulting optimal displacement vectors are used to drive a constrained deformation model that pulls the shape towards symmetry. We show how our algorithm successfully symmetrizes both the geometry and the discretization of complex 2D and 3D shapes and discuss various applications of such symmetrizing deformations.

    :abstractText: We present novel adaptive sampling algorithms for particle-based fluid simulation. We introduce a sampling condition based on geometric local feature size that allows focusing computational resources in geometrically complex regions, while reducing the number of particles deep inside the fluid or near thick flat surfaces. Further performance gains are achieved by varying the sampling density according to visual importance. In addition, we propose a novel fluid surface definition based on approximate particle-to-surface distances that are carried along with the particles and updated appropriately. The resulting surface reconstruction method has several advantages over existing methods, including stability under particle resampling and suitability for representing smooth flat surfaces. We demonstrate how our adaptive sampling and distance-based surface reconstruction algorithms lead to significant improvements in time and memory as compared to single resolution particle simulations, without significantly affecting the fluid flow behavior.

    :abstractText: We introduce a computational framework for discovering regular or repeated geometric structures in 3D shapes. We describe and classify possible regular structures and present an effective algorithm for detecting such repeated geometric patterns in point- or meshbased models. Our method assumes no prior knowledge of the geometry or spatial location of the individual elements that define the pattern. Structure discovery is made possible by a careful analysis of pairwise similarity transformations that reveals prominent lattice structures in a suitable model of transformation space. We introduce an optimization method for detecting such uniform grids specifically designed to deal with outliers and missing elements. This yields a robust algorithm that successfully discovers complex regular structures amidst clutter, noise, and missing geometry. The accuracy of the extracted generating transformations is further improved using a novel simultaneous registration method in the spatial domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a variety of examples and show applications to compression, model repair, and geometry synthesis.

    :abstractText: We present a new technique for reconstructing a single shape and its nonrigid motion from 3D scanning data. Our algorithm takes a set of time-varying unstructured sample points that capture partial views of a deforming object as input and reconstructs a single shape and a deformation field that fit the data. This representation yields dense correspondences for the whole sequence, as well as a completed 3D shape in every frame. In addition, the algorithm automatically removes spatial and temporal noise artifacts and outliers from the raw input data. Unlike previous methods, the algorithm does not require any shape template but computes a fitting shape automatically from the input data. Our reconstruction framework is based upon a novel topology-aware adaptive subspace deformation technique that allows handling long sequences with complex geometry efficiently. The algorithm accesses data in multiple sequential passes, so that long sequences can be streamed from hard disk, not being limited by main memory. We apply the technique to several benchmark datasets, significantly increasing the complexity of the data that can be handled efficiently in comparison to previous work.

    :abstractText: It is a well-established fact that the witness complex is closely related to the restricted Delaunay triangulation in low dimensions. Specifically, it has been proved that the witness complex coincides with the restricted Delaunay triangulation on curves, and is still a subset of it on surfaces, under mild sampling conditions. In this paper, we prove that these results do not extend to higher-dimensional manifolds, even under strong sampling conditions such as uniform point density. On the positive side, we show how the sets of witnesses and landmarks can be enriched, so that the nice relations that exist between restricted Delaunay triangulation and witness complex hold on higher-dimensional manifolds as well. We derive from our structural results an algorithm that reconstructs manifolds of any arbitrary dimension or co-dimension at different scales. The algorithm combines a farthest-point refinement scheme with a vertex pumping strategy. It is very simple conceptually, and it does not require the input point sample to be sparse. Its running time is bounded by c(d)n 2, where n is the size of the input point cloud, and c(d) is a constant depending solely (yet exponentially) on the dimension d of the ambient space. Although this running time makes our reconstruction algorithm rather theoretical, recent work has shown that a variant of our approach can be made tractable in arbitrary dimensions, by building upon the results of this paper.

    :abstractText: Topological persistence has proven to be a key concept for the study of real-valued functions defined over topological spaces. Its validity relies on the fundamental property that the persistence diagrams of nearby functions are close. However, existing stability results are restricted to the case of continuous functions defined over triangulable spaces. In this paper, we present new stability results that do not suffer from the above restrictions. Furthermore, by working at an algebraic level directly, we make it possible to compare the persistence diagrams of functions defined over different spaces, thus enabling a variety of new applications of the concept of persistence. Along the way, we extend the definition of persistence diagram to a larger setting, introduce the notions of discretization of a persistence module and associated pixelization map, define a proximity measure between persistence modules, and show how to interpolate between persistence modules, thereby lending a more analytic character to this otherwise algebraic setting. We believe these new theoretical concepts and tools shed new light on the theory of persistence, in addition to simplifying proofs and enabling new applications.

    :abstractText: We present a method to extract topology information from detection events of mobile entities moving through a network of binary sensors. We extract the topological structure of possible paths in the network by analyzing the time correlation of events at different sensors. The histograms of time delays between any two sensors contain the necessary information to reconstruct the network topology. This data is heavily corrupted by noise due to multiple agents in the network. We therefore use a mixture model of multiple Gaussian and a uniform distribution to explicitly isolate the noise. Our algorithm yields a graph representing the topology of our sensor network along with average travel time between nodes.

    :abstractText: Many algorithms for shape analysis and shape processing rely on accurate estimates of differential information such as normals and curvature. In most settings, however, care must be taken around non-smooth areas of the shape where these quantities are not easily defined. This problem is particularly prominent with point-cloud data, which are discontinuous everywhere. In this paper we present an efficient and robust method for extracting principal curvatures, sharp features and normal directions of a piecewise smooth surface from its point cloud sampling, with theoretical guarantees. Our method is integral in nature and uses convolved covariance matrices of Voronoi cells of the point cloud which makes it provably robust in the presence of noise. We show analytically that our method recovers correct principal curvatures and principal curvature directions in smooth parts of the shape, and correct feature directions and feature angles at the sharp edges of a piecewise smooth surface, with the error bounded by the Hausdorff distance between the point cloud and the underlying surface. Using the same analysis we provide theoretical guarantees for a modification of a previously proposed normal estimation technique. We illustrate the correctness of both principal curvature information and feature extraction in the presence of varying levels of noise and sampling density on a variety of models.

    :abstractText: We propose a novel point signature based on the properties of the heat diffusion process on a shape. Our signature, called the Heat Kernel Signature (or HKS), is obtained by restricting the well-known heat kernel to the temporal domain. Remarkably we show that under certain mild assumptions, HKS captures all of the information contained in the heat kernel, and characterizes the shape up to isometry. This means that the restriction to the temporal domain, on the one hand, makes HKS much more concise and easily commensurable, while on the other hand, it preserves all of the information about the intrinsic geometry of the shape. In addition, HKS inherits many useful properties from the heat kernel, which means, in particular, that it is stable under perturbations of the shape. Our signature also provides a natural and efficiently computable multi-scale way to capture information about neighborhoods of a given point, which can be extremely useful in many applications. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our signature, we present several methods for non-rigid multi-scale matching based on the HKS and use it to detect repeated structure within the same shape and across a collection of shapes.

We prove the stability of our signatures under Gromov-Hausdorff perturbations of the spaces. We also extend these results to metric spaces equipped with measures. Our signatures are well-suited for the study of unstructured point cloud data, which we illustrate through an application in shape classification.

    :abstractText: We present a framework and algorithms for robust geometry and motion reconstruction of complex deforming shapes. Our method makes use of a smooth template that provides a crude approximation of the scanned object and serves as a geometric and topological prior for reconstruction. Large-scale motion of the acquired object is recovered using a novel space-time adaptive, non-rigid registration method. Fine-scale details such as wrinkles and folds are synthesized with an efficient linear mesh deformation algorithm. Subsequent spatial and temporal filtering of detail coefficients allows transfer of persistent geometric detail to regions not observed by the scanner. We show how this two-scale process allows faithful recovery of small-scale shape and motion features leading to a high-quality reconstruction. We illustrate the robustness and generality of our algorithm on a variety of examples composed of different materials and exhibiting a large range of dynamic deformations.

    :abstractText: "The best known upper bound on the number of topological changes in the Delaunay triangulation of a set of moving points in \xE2\x84\x9C2 is (nearly) cubic, even if each point is moving with a fixed velocity. We introduce the notion of a stable Delaunay graph (SDG in short), a dynamic subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation, that is less volatile in the sense that it undergoes fewer topological changes and yet retains many useful properties of the full Delaunay triangulation. SDG is defined in terms of a parameter \xC2\xB1 > 0, and consists of Delaunay edges pq for which the (equal) angles at which p and q see the corresponding Voronoi edge epq are at least \xC2\xB1. We prove several interesting properties of SDG and describe two kinetic data structures for maintaining it. Both structures use O*(n) storage. They process O*(n2) events during the motion, each in O*(1) time, provided that the points of P move along algebraic trajectories of bounded degree; the O*(\xC2\xB7) notation hides multiplicative factors that are polynomial in 1/\xC2\xB1 and polylogarithmic in n. The first structure is simpler but the dependency on 1/\xC2\xB1 in its performance is higher."

    :abstractText: We demonstrate that the network flux over the sensor network provides us fingerprint information about the mobile users within the field. Such information is exoteric in the physical space and easy to access through passive sniffing. We present a theoretical model to the network flux according to the statuses of mobile users. We fit the theoretical model with the network flux measurements through Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) and develop an algorithm that iteratively approaches the NLS solution by Sequential Monte Carlo Estimation. With sparse measurements of the flux information at individual sensor nodes, we are able to identify the mobile users within the network and instantly track their movements without breaking into the details of the communicational packets. A particular advantage of this approach is that compared to the vast information we can reveal the required knowledge is extremely cheap. As all fingerprint information comes from the network flux that is public under current wireless communication medium, our study indicates that most of existing systems are vulnerable in protecting the privacy of mobile users.

    :abstractText: We consider a scenario in which there are resources at or near nodes of a network, which are either static (e.g. fire stations, parking spots) or mobile (e.g. police cars). Over time, events (fires, crime reports, cars looking for parking) arise one-by-one at arbitrary nodes, and need to be quickly matched to and serviced by an appropriate nearby resource, without knowledge of future requests, and without the ability to alter any decision once it has been made. We develop distributed algorithms to direct available resources in the network to these events (or vice versa) in a coordinated fashion, so that no two resources are assigned to the same event, and the total distance of the events from their matched resources is minimized. The key idea is to extract, in a preprocessing stage, a well-separated tree metric that approximates the original network metric by a logarithmic distortion, allowing greedy matching algorithms to generate close to optimal matchings, and enabling communication-efficient probing-based algorithms for events to detect nearby available resources. The distributed matching algorithm requires no global coordination and achieves polylogarithmic performance ratio in both online and offline settings. Simulation experiments corroborate the theoretical results on solution quality and further evaluate the communication costs of our scheme in practice.

    :abstractText: We present an algorithm for data delivery to mobile sinks in wireless sensor networks. Our algorithm is based on information potentials, which we extend to account for mobility. We show that for local movement along edges in the communication graph, the information potentials can be adapted using a simple iterative distributed computation. However, for non-local movement, the potential field might change significantly, and iterative computation leads to packet loss and packet delivery delays. We address this problem by introducing the mobility graph, which encodes knowledge about likely mobility patterns within the network. The mobility graph can be extracted from training data and is used to predict future relay nodes for the mobile node. Using the mobility graph, we can precompute and efficiently store additional routing states in the network. This enables the algorithm to maintain uninterrupted data streams. We analyze the benefits of computing and maintaining a mobility graph, and show that the information contained therein can be used to improve routing reliability in experiments involving mobile sinks.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present a routing scheme that exploits knowledge about the behavior of mobile sinks within a network of data sources to minimize energy consumption and network congestion. For delay-tolerant network applications, we propose to route data not to the sink directly, but to send it instead to a relay node along an announced or predicted path of the mobile node that is close to the data source. The relay node will stash the information until the mobile node passes by and picks up the data. We use linear programming to find optimal relay nodes that minimize the number of necessary transmissions while guaranteeing robustness against link and node failures, as well as trajectory uncertainty. We show that this technique can drastically reduce the number of transmissions necessary to deliver data to mobile sinks. We derive mobility and association models from real-world data traces and evaluate our data stashing technique in simulations. We examine the influence of uncertainty in the trajectory prediction on the performance and robustness of the routing scheme.

    :abstractText: Permutations are ubiquitous in many real-world problems, such as voting, ranking, and data association. Representing uncertainty over permutations is challenging, since there are n! possibilities, and typical compact and factorized probability distribution representations, such as graphical models, cannot capture the mutual exclusivity constraints associated with permutations. In this paper, we use the "low-frequency" terms of a Fourier decomposition to represent distributions over permutations compactly. We present Kronecker conditioning, a novel approach for maintaining and updating these distributions directly in the Fourier domain, allowing for polynomial time bandlimited approximations. Low order Fourier-based approximations, however, may lead to functions that do not correspond to valid distributions. To address this problem, we present a quadratic program defined directly in the Fourier domain for projecting the approximation onto a relaxation of the polytope of legal marginal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real camera-based multi-person tracking scenario.

    :abstractText: We introduce a new feature size for bounded domains in the plane endowed with an intrinsic metric. Given a point x in a domain X, the systolic feature size of X at x measures half the length of the shortest loop through x that is not null-homotopic in X. The resort to an intrinsic metric makes the systolic feature size rather insensitive to the local geometry of the domain, in contrast with its predecessors (local feature size, weak feature size, homology feature size). This reduces the number of samples required to capture the topology of X, provided that a reliable approximation to the intrinsic metric of X is available. Under sufficient sampling conditions involving the systolic feature size, we show that the geodesic Delaunay triangulation Dx(L) of a finite sampling L is homotopy equivalent to X. Under similar conditions, Dx(L) is sandwiched between the geodesic witness complex CWX(L) and a relaxed version CWX,&nu;(L). In the conference version of the article, we took advantage of this fact and proved that the homology of Dx(L) (and hence the one of X) can be retrieved by computing the persistent homology between CWX(L) and CWX,&nu;(L). Here, we investigate further and show that the homology of X can also be recovered from the persistent homology associated with inclusions of type CWX,&nu;(L)&rarrhk;CWX,&nu;&prime;(L), under some conditions on the parameters &nu;&le;&nu;&prime;. Similar results are obtained for Vietoris-Rips complexes in the intrinsic metric. The proofs draw some connections with recent advances on the front of homology inference from point cloud data, but also with several well-known concepts of Riemannian (and even metric) geometry. On the algorithmic front, we propose algorithms for estimating the systolic feature size of a bounded planar domain X, selecting a landmark set of sufficient density, and computing the homology of X using geodesic witness complexes or Rips complexes.

    :abstractText: "Geodesic curves in surfaces are not only minimizers of distance, but they are also the curves of zero geodesic (sideways) curvature. It turns out that this property makes patterns of geodesics the basic geometric entity when dealing with the cladding of a freeform surface with wooden panels which do not bend sideways. Likewise a geodesic is the favored shape of timber support elements in freeform architecture, for reasons of manufacturing and statics. Both problem areas are fundamental in freeform architecture, but so far only experimental solutions have been available. This paper provides a systematic treatment and shows how to design geodesic patterns in different ways: The evolution of geodesic curves is good for local studies and simple patterns; the level set formulation can deal with the global layout of multiple patterns of geodesics; finally geodesic vector fields allow us to interactively model geodesic patterns and perform surface segmentation into panelizable parts."

    :abstractText: We present a perceptron-style discriminative approach to machine translation in which large feature sets can be exploited. Unlike discriminative reranking approaches, our system can take advantage of learned features in all stages of decoding. We first discuss several challenges to error-driven discriminative approaches. In particular, we explore different ways of updating parameters given a training example. We find that making frequent but smaller updates is preferable to making fewer but larger updates. Then, we discuss an array of features and show both how they quantitatively increase BLEU score and how they qualitatively interact on specific examples. One particular feature we investigate is a novel way to introduce learning into the initial phrase extraction process, which has previously been entirely heuristic.

    :abstractText: We introduce a new inference algorithm for Dirichlet process mixture models. While Gibbs sampling and variational methods focus on local moves, the new algorithm makes more global moves. This is done by introducing a permutation of the data points as an auxiliary variable. The algorithm is a blocked sampler which alternates between sampling the clustering and sampling the permutation. The key to the efficiency of this approach is that it is possible to use dynamic programming to consider all exponentially many clusterings consistent with a given permutation. We also show that random projections can be used to effectively sample the permutation. The result is a stochastic hill-climbing algorithm that yields burn-in times significantly smaller than those of collapsed Gibbs sampling.

    :abstractText: We present an unsupervised approach to symmetric word alignment in which two simple asymmetric models are trained jointly to maximize a combination of data likelihood and agreement between the models. Compared to the standard practice of intersecting predictions of independently-trained models, joint training provides a 32% reduction in AER. Moreover, a simple and efficient pair of HMM aligners provides a 29% reduction in AER over symmetrized IBM model 4 predictions.

    :abstractText: Recently, discriminative word alignment methods have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies by extending the range of information sources that can be easily incorporated into aligners. The chief advantage of a discriminative framework is the ability to score alignments based on arbitrary features of the matching word tokens, including orthographic form, predictions of other models, lexical context and so on. However, the proposed bipartite matching model of Taskar et al. (2005), despite being tractable and effective, has two important limitations. First, it is limited by the restriction that words have fertility of at most one. More importantly, first order correlations between consecutive words cannot be directly captured by the model. In this work, we address these limitations by enriching the model form. We give estimation and inference algorithms for these enhancements. Our best model achieves a relative AER reduction of 25% over the basic matching formulation, outperforming intersected IBM Model 4 without using any overly compute-intensive features. By including predictions of other models as features, we achieve AER of 3.8 on the standard Hansards dataset.

    :abstractText: We present a discriminative, large-margin approach to feature-based matching for word alignment. In this framework, pairs of word tokens receive a matching score, which is based on features of that pair, including measures of association between the words, distortion between their positions, similarity of the orthographic form, and so on. Even with only 100 labeled training examples and simple features which incorporate counts from a large unlabeled corpus, we achieve AER performance close to IBM Model 4, in much less time. Including Model 4 predictions as features, we achieve a relative AER reduction of 22% in over intersected Model 4 alignments.

    :abstractText: "We present a simple and scalable algorithm for maximum-margin estimation of structured output models, including an important class of Markov networks and combinatorial models. We formulate the estimation problem as a convex-concave saddle-point problem that allows us to use simple projection methods based on the dual extragradient algorithm (Nesterov, 2003). The projection step can be solved using dynamic programming or combinatorial algorithms for min-cost convex flow, depending on the structure of the problem. We show that this approach provides a memory-efficient alternative to formulations based on reductions to a quadratic program (QP). We analyze the convergence of the method and present experiments on two very different structured prediction tasks: 3D image segmentation and word alignment, illustrating the favorable scaling properties of our algorithm."

    :abstractText: We present an automatic approach to tree annotation in which basic nonterminal symbols are alternately split and merged to maximize the likelihood of a training treebank. Starting with a simple X-bar grammar, we learn a new grammar whose nonterminals are subsymbols of the original nonterminals. In contrast with previous work, we are able to split various terminals to different degrees, as appropriate to the actual complexity in the data. Our grammars automatically learn the kinds of linguistic distinctions exhibited in previous work on manual tree annotation. On the other hand, our grammars are much more compact and substantially more accurate than previous work on automatic annotation. Despite its simplicity, our best grammar achieves an F1 of 90.2% on the Penn Treebank, higher than fully lexicalized systems.

    :abstractText: We present distributed regression, an efficient and general framework for in-network modeling of sensor data. In this framework, the nodes of the sensor network collaborate to optimally fit a global function to each of their local measurements. The algorithm is based upon kernel linear regression, where the model takes the form of a weighted sum of local basis functions; this provides an expressive yet tractable class of models for sensor network data. Rather than transmitting data to one another or outside the network, nodes communicate constraints on the model parameters, drastically reducing the communication required. After the algorithm is run, each node can answer queries for its local region, or the nodes can efficiently transmit the parameters of the model to a user outside the network. We present an evaluation of the algorithm based upon data from a 48-node sensor network deployment at the Intel Research - Berkeley Lab, demonstrating that our distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a fast rate and is very robust to packet losses.

    :abstractText: We show how to limit a program's resource usage in an efficient way, using a novel combination of dynamic checks and static analysis. Usually, dynamic checking is inefficient due to the overhead of checks, while static analysis is difficult and rejects many safe programs. We propose a hybrid approach that solves these problems. We split each resource-consuming operation into two parts. The first is a dynamic check, called reserve. The second is the actual operation, called consume, which does not perform any dynamic checks. The programmer is then free to hoist and combine reserve operations. Combining reserve operations reduces their overhead, while hoisting reserve operations ensures that the program does not run out of resources at an inconvenient time. A static verifier ensures that the program reserves resources before it consumes them. This verification is both easier and more flexible than an a priori static verification of resource usage. We present a sound and efficient static verifier based on Hoare logic and linear inequalities. As an example, we present a version of tar written in Java.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a prototype implementation of an intelligent assistance architecture for data-driven simulation specialising in qualitative data in the social sciences. The assistant architecture semi-automates an iterative sequence in which an initial simulation is interpreted and compared with real-world observations. The simulation is then adapted so that it more closely fits the observations, while at the same time the data collection may be adjusted to reduce uncertainty. For our prototype, we have developed a simplified agent-based simulation as part of a social science case study involving decisions about housing. Real-world data on the behaviour of actual households is also available. The automation of the data-driven modelling process requires content interpretation of both the simulation and the corresponding real-world data. The paper discusses the use of Association Rule Mining to produce general logical statements about the simulation and data content and the applicability of logical consistency checking to detect observations that refute the simulation predictions.

    :abstractText: "The most common approach to support analysis of graphs with associated time series data include: overlay of data on graph vertices for one timepoint at a time by manipulating a visual property (e.g. color) of the vertex, along with sliders or some such mechanism to animate the graph for other timepoints. Alternatively, data from all the timepoints can be overlaid simultaneously by embedding small charts into graph vertices. These graph visualizations may also be linked to other visualizations (e.g., parallel co-ordinates) using brushing and linking. This paper describes a study performed to evaluate and rank graph+timeseries visualization options based on users' performance time and accuracy of responses on predefined tasks. The results suggest that overlaying data on graph vertices one timepoint at a time may lead to more accurate performance for tasks involving analysis of a graph at a single timepoint, and comparisons between graph vertices for two distinct timepoints. Overlaying data simultaneously for all the timepoints on graph vertices may lead to more accurate and faster performance for tasks involving searching for outlier vertices displaying different behavior than the rest of the graph vertices for all timepoints. Single views have advantage over multiple views on tasks that require topological information. Also, the number of attributes displayed on nodes has a non trivial influence on accuracy of responses, whereas the number of visualizations affect the performance time."

    :abstractText: Advanced programming languages such as Standard ML have rarely been used for systems programming tasks such as operating systems and network communications. In order to understand more fully the requirements of systems programming, we have implemented a suite of industry-standard network communication protocols in a completely type-safe extension of Standard ML. While the implementation has only recently become operational, we already observe acceptable communications throughput. We make careful use of the Standard ML modules system, with the core component of the implementation being a signature which is generic to all communications protocols. This generic protocol is then specialized for specific protocols, and these are implemented by functors parameterized by generic protocols. This leads naturally to a layered system structure and also provides an important and useful &ldquo;mix-and-match&rdquo; capability in composing protocols into complex networking systems.We have found the advanced features of Standard ML, in particular the modules system, static typing, and higher-order functions, to be extremely useful in building complex communications systems. The type compatibility of the various components of a system is guaranteed by the compiler. Furthermore, we find it significant that most of the information needed to understand the structure and interactions in our code can be obtained from a study of the signatures alone. Perhaps most important is that we have been able to use the expressive power of Standard ML modules to give concrete expression to previously ad hoc system-structuring concepts developed by other researchers in the field of network communications. For language designers and implementors, our experience has also pointed out specific areas for further work that may lead to advanced languages that are useful for systems programming.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents two techniques for improving garbage collection performance: generational stack collection and profile-driven pretenuring. The first is applicable to stack-based implementations of functional languages while the second is useful for any generational collector. We have implemented both techniques in a generational collector used by the TIL compiler (Tarditi, Morrisett, Cheng, Stone, Harper, and Lee 1996), and have observed decreases in garbage collection times of as much as 70% and 30%, respectively.Functional languages encourage the use of recursion which can lead to a long chain of activation records. When a collection occurs, these activation records must be scanned for roots. We show that scanning many activation records can take so long as to become the dominant cost of garbage collection. However, most deep stacks unwind very infrequently, so most of the root information obtained from the stack remains unchanged across successive garbage collections. Generational stack collection greatly reduces the stack scan cost by reusing information from previous scans.Generational techniques have been successful in reducing the cost of garbage collection (Ungar 1984). Various complex heap arrangements and tenuring policies have been proposed to increase the effectiveness of generational techniques by reducing the cost and frequency of scanning and copying. In contrast, we show that by using profile information to make lifetime predictions, pretenuring can avoid copying data altogether. In essence, this technique uses a refinement of the generational hypothesis (most data die young) with a locality principle concerning the age of data: most allocations sites produce data that immediately dies, while a few allocation sites consistently produce data that survives many collections."

The experiment shows that: (1) it is possible to implement a certifying native-code compiler for a large subset of the Java programming language; (2) the compiler is freely able to apply many standard local and global optimizations; and (3) the PCC binaries it produces are of reasonable size and can be rapidly checked for type safety by a small proof-checker. This paper also presents further evidence that PCC provides several advantages for compiler development. In particular, generating proofs of the target code helps to identify compiler bugs, many of which would have been difficult to discover by testing."

    :abstractText: We describe the design and implementation of a compiler that automatically translates ordinary programs written in a subset of ML into code that generates native code at run time. Run-time code generation can make use of values and invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time, yielding code that is often superior to statically optimal code. But the cost of optimizing and generating code at run time can be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce the cost of run-time code generation by an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code quality. Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an average cost of only six cycles per instruction generated at run time.

    :abstractText: This paper presents the design and implementation of a compiler that translates programs written in a type-safe subset of the C programming language into highly optimized DEC Alpha assembly language programs, and a certifier that automatically checks the type safety and memory safety of any assembly language program produced by the compiler. The result of the certifier is either a formal proof of type safety or a counterexample pointing to a potential violation of the type system by the target program. The ensemble of the compiler and the certifier is called a certifying compiler.Several advantages of certifying compilation over previous approaches can be claimed. The notion of a certifying compiler is significantly easier to employ than a formal compiler verification, in part because it is generally easier to verify the correctness of the result of a computation than to prove the correctness of the computation itself. Also, the approach can be applied even to highly optimizing compilers, as demonstrated by the fact that our compiler generates target code, for a range of realistic C programs, which is competitive with both the cc and gcc compilers with all optimizations enabled. The certifier also drastically improves the effectiveness of compiler testing because, for each test case, it statically signals compilation errors that might otherwise require many executions to detect. Finally, this approach is a practical way to produce the safety proofs for a Proof-Carrying Code system, and thus may be useful in a system for safe mobile code.

    :abstractText: The goal of the TIL project was to explore the use of Typed Intermediate Languages to produce high-performance native code from Standard ML (SML). We believed that existing SML compilers were doing a good job of conventional functional language optimizations, as one might find in a LISP compiler, but that inadequate use was made of the rich type information present in the source language. Our goal was to show that we could get much greater performance by propagating type information through to the back end of the compiler, without sacrificing the advantages afforded by loop-oriented and other optimizations.We also confirmed that using typed intermediate languages dramatically improved the reliability and maintainability of the compiler itself. In particular, we were able to use the type system to express critical invariants, and enforce those invariants through type checking. In this respect, TIL introduced and popularized the notion of a certifying compiler, which attaches a checkable certificate of safety to its generated code. In turn, this led directly to the idea of certified object code, inspiring the development of Proof-Carrying Code and Typed Assembly Language as certified object code formats.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a typed programming language and compiler for run-time code generation. The language, called ML', extends ML with modal operators in the style of the Mini-ML'e language of Davies and Pfenning. ML' allows programmers to use types to specify precisely the stages of computation in a program. The types also guide the compiler in generating target code that exploits the staging information through the use of run-time code generation. The target machine is currently a version of the Categorical Abstract Machine, called the CCAM, which we have extended with facilities for run-time code generation.This approach allows the programmer to express the staging that he wants directly to the compiler. It also provides a typed framework in which to verify the correctness of his staging intentions, and to discuss his staging decisions with other programmers. Finally, it supports in a natural way multiple stages of run-time specialization, so that dynamically generated code can be used in the generation of yet further specialized code.This paper presents an overview of the language, with several examples of programs that illustrate key concepts and programming techniques. Then, it discusses the CCAM and the compilation of ML' programs into CCAM code. Finally, the results of some experiments are shown, to demonstrate the benefits of this style of run-time code generation for some applications.

    :abstractText: The Ergo Support System (ESS) is an engineering framework for experimentation and prototyping to support the application of formal methods to program development, ranging from program analysis and derivation to proof-theoretic approaches. The ESS is a growing suite of tools that are linked together by means of a set of abstract interfaces. The principal engineering challenge is the design of abstract interfaces that are semantically rich and yet flexible enough to permit experimentation with a wide variety of formally-based program and proof development paradigms and associated languages. As part of the design of ESS, several abstract interface designs have been developed that provide for more effective component integration while preserving flexibility and the potential for scaling. A benefit of the open architecture approach of ESS is the ability to mix formal and informal approaches in the same environment architecture. The ESS has already been applied in a number of formal methods experiments.

    :abstractText: "Since 1996 there has been tremendous progress in developing the idea of certified code, including both proof-carrying code (PCC) and typed assembly language (TAL). In a certified code framework, each program (which is usually in machine-code binary form) comes equipped with a certificate that \"explains\", both rigorously and in a manner that is easily validated, why it possesses a formally specified security property. A substantial amount of the research work in this area has been directed towards the problem of how to make certified code a practical technology--what one might call \"proof engineering\". Thus, many of the advances have been in methods for representing the certificates in the most compact and efficiently checkable way. For example, early on George Necula and I used LF encodings of loop invariants and safety proofs, which were then validated by a process of verification-condition generation and LF type checking. Later, we adopted the so-called \"oracle-based\" representation, resulting in certificates that imposed a much smaller overhead on the size of the object files, usually much less than 20%. This made us optimistic enough about the prospects for a practical realization of certified code that we devoted considerable effort in developing the Special J system for certified Java. And very recently, many researchers (led initially by Andrew Appel and Amy Felty) have been developing various \"foundational\" approaches to certified code. These hold out the promise of making PCC and TAL even more trustworthy and easier to administer in practical settings, and in some instances may also open PCC to verification of temporal properties. In this talk, I will start with an overview of these and other current state-of-the-art concepts in certified code. Then, I will consider a very different but equally practical question: Just what is it that we are trying to prove? In contrast to the concept of translation validation, a certified code system does not prove the semantic equivalence between source and target programs. It only proves a specified safety property for the target program, independent of any source program. So then what is the right safety property to use? Is it necessary to prove that the target programs preserve all of the typing abstractions of a particular source program, or is simple \"memory safety\" enough? While I have yet to claim an answer to this question, I am able to relate specific situations from practical applications that may help to shed some light on the situation.

    :abstractText: The use of cellular automata has long been identified as a method, and means of modelling different behaviours and systems that may occur across various subject fields. One such area that has not yet been fully explored and tested is the use of cellular automata as the basis for performing arithmetic operations capable of being transferred to different types of hardware. This area is vitally important as it could provide the foundation for the next generation of evolvable and adaptive hardware techniques as the approach of true nanocomputing comes ever closer. The main feature of this work is a cellular automata based multiplier. This follows on from, and interacts with a previously created cellular automata based binary tree adder. This model will be transferred onto a form of cellular hardware in the very near future. This will enable the exploration of key issues such as fault tolerance in hardware which is of significance in a time where devices are gradually being scaled down in size and are becoming increasingly complex.

(2002), we construct a gene interaction network and search for high-scoring subnetworks. We make several improvements in terms of scoring functions and algorithms, resulting in higher speed and accuracy and easier biological interpretation. We also assign significance levels to our results, adjusted for multiple testing. Our methods are succesfully applied to three human microarray data sets, related to cancer and the immune system, retrieving several known and potential pathways. The method, denoted by the acronym GXNA (Gene eXpression Network Analysis) is implemented in software that is publicly available and can be used on virtually any microarray data set.

    :abstractText: Threads can easily be implemented using first-class continuations, but the straightforward approaches for doing so lead to space leaks, especially in a language with exceptions like Standard ML. We show how these space leaks arise and give a new implementation for threads that is safe for space.

    :abstractText: The FoxNet is an implementation of the standard TCP/IP networking protocol stack using the Standard ML (SML) language. SML is a type-safe programming language with garbage collection, a unique and advanced module system, and machine-independent semantics. The FoxNet is a user-space implementation of TCP/IP that is built in SML by composing modular protocol elements&semi; each element independently implements one of the standard protocols. One specific combination of these elements implements the standard TCP/IP stack. Other combinations are also possible and can be used to easily and conveniently build custom, non-standard networking stacks. This paper describes in detail the final design and implementation of the FoxNet, including many of the details that are crucially affected by the choice of SML as the programming language.

    :abstractText: C has been used as a portable target language for implementing languages like Standard ML and Scheme. Previous efforts at compiling these languages to C have produced efficient code, but have compromised on portability and proper tail recursion. We show how to compile Standard ML to C wihout making such compromises. The compilation technique is based on converting Standard ML to a continuation-passing style &lgr;-calculus intermediate language and then compiling this language to C. The code generated by this compiler achieves an execution speed that is about a factor of two slower than that generated by a native code compiler. The compiler generates highly portable code, yet still supports advanced features like garbage collection and first-class continuations. We analyze the performance and determine the aspects of the compilation method that lead to the observed slowdown. We also suggest changes to C compilers that would better support such compilation methods.

    :abstractText: We present a general framework for provably safe mobile code. It relies on a formal definition of a safety policy and explicit evidence for compliance with this policy which is attached to a binary. Concrete realizations of this framework are proof-carrying code, where the evidence for safety is a formal proof generated by a certifying compiler, and typed assembly language, where the evidence for safety is given via type annotations propagated throughout the compilation process in typed intermediate languages. Validity of the evidence is established via a small trusted type checker, either directly on the binary or indirectly on proof representations in a logical framework.

    :abstractText: "The results of cache-simulation experiments with an abstract machine for reducing combinator graphs are presented. The abstract machine, called TIGRE, exhibits reduction rates that, for similar kinds of combinator graphs on similar kinds of hardware, compare favorably with previously reported techniques. Furthermore, TIGRE maps easily and efficiently onto standard computer architectures, particularly those that allow a restricted form of self-modifying code. This provides some indication that the conventional \"stored program\" organization of computer systems is not necessarily an inappropriate one for functional programming language implementations. This is not to say, however, that present day computer systems are well equipped to reduce combinator graphs. In particular, the behavior of the cache memory has a significant effect on performance. In order to study and quantify this effect, trace-driven cache simulations of a TIGRE graph reducer running on a reduced instruction-set computer are conducted. The results of these simulations are presented with the following hardware-cache parameters varied: cache size, block size, associativity, memory update policy, and write-allocation policy. To begin with, the cache organization of a commercially available system is used and then the performance sensitivity with respect to variations of each parameter are measured. From the results of the simulation study, a conclusion is made that combinator-graph reduction using TIGRE runs most efficiently when using a cache memory with an allocate-on-write-miss strategy, moderately large block size (preferably with subblock placement), and copy-back memory updates."

    :abstractText: We show how to limit a program's resource usage in an efficient way, using a novel combination of dynamic checks and static analysis. Usually, dynamic checking is inefficient due to the overhead of checks, while static analysis is difficult and rejects many safe programs. We propose a hybrid approach that solves these problems. We split each resource-consuming operation into two parts. The first is a dynamic check, called reserve. The second is the actual operation, called consume, which does not perform any dynamic checks. The programmer is then free to hoist and combine reserve operations. Combining reserve operations reduces their overhead, while hoisting reserve operations ensures that the program does not run out of resources at an inconvenient time. A static verifier ensures that the program reserves resources before it consumes them. This verification is both easier and more flexible than an a priori static verification of resource usage. We present a sound and efficient static verifier based on Hoare logic and linear inequalities. As an example, we present a version of tar written in Java.

A prototype peer to peer system has been developed for evaluation, which include complete short range microwave transceivers. Data rate up to 1Mbps has been achieved. The RF front end is developed with commercially available MMIC chip set. The data-link MAC controller is realized with commercial DSP chip,which highly improves the system versatility in various applications. The prototype system has the potential to support point-to-multi-point connections, it can be easily expanded to a compact low cost data exchange network without any modification in system hardware.

Symmetry is proposed as the central notation that unifies both conceptually and algorithmically all types geometric regularities such as parallelism, orthoganality, and similarity. The methods are extremely simple, accurate, and easy to implement, and they demonstrate the power of applying scene knowledge.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces a simple and efficient representation for natural images. We partition an image into blocks and treat the blocks as vectors in a high-dimensional space. We then fit a piece-wise linear model (i.e. a union of affine subspaces) to the vectors at each down-sampling scale. We call this a multi-scale hybrid linear model of the image. The hybrid and hierarchical structure of this model allows us effectively to extract and exploit multi-modal correlations among the imagery data at different scales. It conceptually and computationally remedies limitations of many existing image representation methods that are based on either a fixed linear transformation (e.g. DCT, wavelets), an adaptive uni-modal linear transformation (e.g. PCA), or a multi-modal model at a single scale. We will justify both analytically and experimentally why and how such a simple multi-scale hybrid model is able to reduce simultaneously the model complexity and computational cost. Despite a small overhead for the model, our results show that this new model gives more compact representations for a wide variety of natural images under a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio than many existing methods, including wavelets.

Based on three fundamental principles thatsummarize the relations between symmetry and perspectiveimaging, namely, structure from symmetry, symmetry hypothesistesting, and global symmetry testing, we developa prototype system which is able to automatically segmentsymmetric objects in space from single 2-D perspective images.The result of such a segmentation is a hierarchy ofgeometric primitives, called symmetry cells and complexes,whose 3-D structure and pose are fully recovered. Such ageometrically meaningful segmentation may greatly facilitateapplications such as feature matching and robot navigation.

    :abstractText: Sensor networks and other distributed information systems (such as the Web) must frequently access data that has a high per-attribute acquisition cost, in terms of energy, latency, or computational resources. When executing queries that contain several predicates over such expensive attributes, we observe that it can be beneficial to use correlations to automatically introduce low-cost attributes whose observation will allow the query processor to better estimate the selectivity of these expensive predicates. In particular, we show how to build conditional plans that branch into one or more sub-plans, each with a different ordering for the expensive query predicates, based on the runtime observation of low-cost attributes. We frame the problem of constructing the optimal conditional plan for a given user query and set of candidate low-cost attributes as an optimization problem. We describe an exponential time algorithm for finding such optimal plans, and describe a polynomial-time heuristic for identifying conditional plans that perform well in practice. We also show how to compactly model conditional probability distributions needed to identify correlations and build these plans. We evaluate our algorithms against several real-world sensor-network data sets, showing several-times performance increases for a variety of queries versus traditional optimization techniques.

    :abstractText: Recent sensor networks research has produced a class of data storage and query processing techniques called Data-Centric Storage that leverages locality-preserving distributed indexes to efficiently answer multi-dimensional range and range-aggregate queries. These distributed indexes offer a rich design space of a) logical decompositions of sensor relation schema into indexes, as well as b) physical mappings of these indexes onto sensors. In this paper, we explore this space for energy-efficient data organizations (logical and physical mappings of tuples and attributes to sensor nodes) and devise purely local query optimization techniques for processing queries that span such decomposed relations.

    :abstractText: Data captured from the physical world through sensor devices tends to be noisy and unreliable. The data cleaning process for such data is not easily handled by standard data warehouse-oriented techniques, which do not take into account the strong temporal and spatial components of receptor data. We present Extensible receptor Stream Processing (ESP), a declarative query-based framework designed to clean the data streams produced by sensor devices.

    :abstractText: "Detecting and unraveling incipient coordinated attacks on Internet resources requires a distributed network monitoring infrastructure. Such an infrastructure will have two logically distinct elements: distributed monitors that continuously collect packet and flow-level information, and a distributed query system that allows network operators to effi- ciently and rapidly access this information. We argue that, in addition to supporting other types of queries, the network monitoring query system must support multi-dimensional range queries on traffic records (flows, or aggregated flow records). We discuss the design of MIND, a distributed indexing system which supports the creation of multiple distributed indices that use proximal hashing to scalably respond to range queries."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we describe our approach to the optimization of query execution plans in XPRS1, a multi-user parallel dtabase machine based on a shared-memory multiprocessor and a disk array. The main difficulties in this optimization problem are the compile-time unknown parameters such as available buffer size and number of free processors, and the enormous search space of possible parallel plans. We deal with these problems with a novel two phase optimization strategy which dramatically reduces the search space and allows run time parameters without significantly compromising plan optimality. In this paper we present our two phase strategy and give experimental evidence from XPRS bencmarks that indicate that it almost always produces optimal plans.

    :abstractText: "In many sensor networks, data or events are named by attributes. Many of these attributes have scalar values, so one natural way to query events of interest is to use a multi-dimensional range query. An example is: \"List all events whose temperature lies between 50\xC2\xB0 and 60\xC2\xB0, and whose light levels lie between 10 and 15.\" Such queries are useful for correlating events occurring within the network.In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed index that scalably supports multi-dimensional range queries. Our distributed index for multi-dimensional data (or DIM) uses a novel geographic embedding of a classical index data structure, and is built upon the GPSR geographic routing algorithm. Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable assumptions about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well with network size (both insertion and query costs scale as O(\xE2\x88\x9AN)). In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the insertion and query costs of other alternatives are sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, even for moderately sized network. Finally, experiments on a small scale testbed validate the feasibility of DIMs."

    :abstractText: "Recent sensor networks research has produced a class of data storage and query processing techniques called <i>Data-Centric Storage</i> that leverages locality-preserving distributed indexes like DIM, DIFS, and GHT to efficiently answer multi-dimensional range and range-aggregate queries. These distributed indexes offer a rich design space of a) logical decompositions of sensor relation schema into indexes, as well as b) physical mappings of these indexes onto sensors. In this poster, we explore this space for energy-efficient <i>data organizations</i> (logical and physical mappings of tuples and attributes to sensor nodes) and devise <i>purely local query optimization techniques</i> for processing queries that span such decomposed relations. We propose four design techniques: (a) fully decomposing the base sensor relation into distinct sub-relations, (b) spatially partitioning these sub-relations across the sensornet, (c) localized query planning and optimization to find fully decentralized optimal join orders, and (d) locally caching join results. Together, these optimizations reduce the overall network energy consumption by <i>4 times</i> or more when compared against the standard single multi-dimensional distributed index on a variety of synthetic query workloads simulated over both synthetic and real-world datasets. We validate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a functional prototype of our data organizer and query processor on Mica2 motes and observing comparable message cost savings."

    :abstractText: The wireless sensor network "macroscope" offers the potential to advance science by enabling dense temporal and spatial monitoring of large physical volumes. This paper presents a case study of a wireless sensor network that recorded 44 days in the life of a 70-meter tall redwood tree, at a density of every 5 minutes in time and every 2 meters in space. Each node measured air temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active solar radiation. The network captured a detailed picture of the complex spatial variation and temporal dynamics of the microclimate surrounding a coastal redwood tree. This paper describes the deployed network and then employs a multi-dimensional analysis methodology to reveal trends and gradients in this large and previously-unobtainable dataset. An analysis of system performance data is then performed, suggesting lessons for future deployments.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we study the scheduling and optimization problems of parallel query processing using interoperation parallelism in a shared-memory environment and propose our solutions for XPRS. We first study the scheduling problem of a set of a continuous sequence of independent tasks that are either from a bushy tree plan of a single query or from the plans of multiple queries, and present a clean and simple scheduling algorithm. Our scheduling algorithm achieves maximum resource utilizations by running an IO-bound task and a CPU-bound task in parallel with carefully calculated degrees of parallelism and maintains the maximum resource utilizations by dynamically adjusting the degrees of parallelism of running tasks whenever necessary. Real performance figures are shown to confirm the effectiveness of our scheduling algorithm. We also revisit the optimization problem of parallel execution plans of a single query and extend our previous results to consider inter-operation parallelism by introducing a new cost estimation method to the query optimizer based on our scheduling algorithm.

    :abstractText: We present an efficient colon flattening algorithm using a conformal structure, which is angle-preserving and minimizes the global distortion. Moreover, our algorithm is general as it can handle high genus surfaces. First, the colon wall is segmented and extracted from the CT data set of the abdomen. The topology noise (i.e., minute handle) is located and removed automatically. The holomorphic 1-form, a pair of orthogonal vector fields, is then computed on the 3D colon surface mesh using the conjugate gradient method. The colon surface is cut along a vertical trajectory traced using the holomorphic 1-form. Consequently, the 3D colon surface is conformally mapped to a 2D rectangle. The flattened 2D mesh is then rendered using a direct volume rendering method accelerated with the GPU. Our algorithm is tested with a number of CT data sets of real pathological cases, and gives consistent results. We demonstrate that the shape of the polyps is well preserved on the flattened colon images, which provides an efficient way to enhance the navigation of a virtual colonoscopy system.

    :abstractText: The goal of this work is to simplify volumetric datasets while preserving the sharp boundary features and the topology of the 3D scalar field. The simplification is performed on the volumetric datasets defined as a tetrahedral mesh. The sharp boundary features are detected and preserved in the simplification to conserve the salient details of the tetrahedral mesh. The topology of the 3D scalar field is preserved by maintaining critical points extracted from the original dataset. No critical vertices are removed or generated during the simplification process. A gradient magnitude based error metric is used to estimate the error associated with a simplification step. The simplified tetrahedral mesh is rendered using a hardware-accelerated unstructured volume rendering algorithm. This method produces results which are visually similar to the original dataset.

    :abstractText: We present a fast, topology-preserving approach for isosurface simplification. The underlying concept behind our approach is to preserve the disconnected surface components in cells during isosurface simplification. We represent isosurface components in a novel representation, called enhanced cell, where each surface component in a cell is represented by a vertex and its connectivity information. A topology-preserving vertex clustering algorithm is applied to build a vertex octree. An enhanced dual contouring algorithm is applied to extract error-bounded multiresolution isosurfaces from the vertex octree while preserving the finest resolution isosurface topology. Cells containing multiple vertices are properly handled during contouring. Our approach demonstrates better results than existing octree-based simplification techniques.

We describe a novel connectivity encoding scheme, called Connectivity Encoding Bitmap, and two topology-preserving isopoint clustering algorithms to build the vertex hierarchy.Our framework is able to cluster surface components with up to four intersection points on a cell edge.During rendering, an incremental isosurface extraction algorithm is used to construct the isosurface dynamically. Events associated with vertex tree modifications and active vertices changes are unified using timestamps.Our framework is efficient, space-saving, and suitable for rendering large isosurface objects with local modifications.

    :abstractText: Symmetry is an important geometric cue for 3-D reconstruction from perspective images. In this paper, we introduce a unified theoretical framework for extracting poses and structures of 2-D symmetric patterns in space from calibrated images. The framework uniformly encompasses all three fundamental types of symmetry, i.e., reflective, rotational, and translational, based on a systematic study of the homography groups in image induced by the symmetry groups in space. We claim that if a planar object admits rich enough symmetry, no 3-D geometric information is lost through perspective imaging. Based on two fundamental principles that utilize common spatial relations among symmetric objects, we have developed a prototype system which can automatically extract and segment multiple 2-D symmetric patterns present in a single perspective image. The result of such a segmentation is a hierarchy of new geometric primitives, called symmetry cells and complexes, whose 3-D structures and poses are fully recovered. Finally, we propose a new symmetry-based matching technique, which can effectively establish correspondences among the extracted symmetry cells across multiple images. We demonstrate the application of the proposed algorithms on image segmentation, matching, and 3-D reconstruction with extensive experimental results. The algorithms and systems are more accurate and easier to implement than existing point- or line-based methods.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we provide a principled explanation of how knowledge in global 3-D structural invariants, typically captured by a group action on a symmetric structure, can dramatically facilitate the task of reconstructing a 3-D scene from one or more images. More importantly, since every symmetric structure admits a &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; coordinate frame with respect to which the group action can be naturally represented, the canonical pose between the viewer and this canonical frame can be recovered too, which explains why symmetric objects (e.g., buildings) provide us overwhelming clues to their orientation and position. We give the necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of the symmetry (group) admitted by a structure under which this pose can be uniquely determined. We also characterize, when such conditions are not satisfied, to what extent this pose can be recovered. We show how algorithms from conventional multiple-view geometry, after properly modified and extended, can be directly applied to perform such recovery, from all &ldquo;hidden images&rdquo; of one image of the symmetric structure. We also apply our results to a wide range of applications in computer vision and image processing such as camera self-calibration, image segmentation and global orientation, large baseline feature matching, image rendering and photo editing, as well as visual illusions (caused by symmetry if incorrectly assumed).

    :abstractText: An approach is presented to detect faces and facial features on a video segment based on multi-cues, including gray-level distribution, color, motion, templates, algebraic features and so on. Faces are first detected across the frames by using color segmentation, template matching and artificial neural network. A PCA-based (Principal Component Analysis) feature detector for still images is then used to detect facial features on each single frame until the resulting features of three adjacent frames, named as base frames, are consistent with each other. The features of frames neighboring the base frames are first detected by the still-image feature detector, then verified and corrected according to the smoothness constraint and the planar surface motion constraint. Experiments have been performed on video segments captured under different environments, and the presented method is proved to be robust and accurate over variable poses, ages and illumination conditions.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we demonstrate how to edit digital photos based on the understanding of high-level geometric knowledge imposed upon objects in the photos. This is achieved by the correct recovery of the 3-D shape and relationships of the objects, without explicitly performing full 3-D reconstruction. Symmetry is proposed as the central notion that unifies both conceptually and algorithmically all types of geometric regularities such as parallelism, orthogonality, and similarity. The methods are extremely simple, accurate, easy to implement, and they demonstrate the utility of applying scene knowledge to image understanding and editing.

    :abstractText: We present a novel pipeline for computer-aided detection (CAD) of colonic polyps by integrating texture and shape analysis with volume rendering and conformal colon flattening. Using our automatic method, the 3D polyp detection problem is converted into a 2D pattern recognition problem. The colon surface is first segmented and extracted from the CT data set of the patient's abdomen, which is then mapped to a 2D rectangle using conformal mapping. This flattened image is rendered using a direct volume rendering technique with a translucent electronic biopsy transfer function. The polyps are detected by a 2D clustering method on the flattened image. The false positives are further reduced by analyzing the volumetric shape and texture features. Compared with shape based methods, our method is much more efficient without the need of computing curvature and other shape parameters for the whole colon surface. The final detection results are stored in the 2D image, which can be easily incorporated into a virtual colonoscopy (VC) system to highlight the polyp locations. The extracted colon surface mesh can be used to accelerate the volumetric ray casting algorithm used to generate the VC endoscopic view. The proposed automatic CAD pipeline is incorporated into an interactive VC system, with a goal of helping radiologists detect polyps faster and with higher accuracy.

By using top-to-down oriented methodology, we realize the adaptation between service management layer and network layer, which can hide the difference of multi-technology networks and provide uniform services for upper layers. Related protocol-independent information models are defined by UML, by which we can cope with existing and emerging new telecom network and management technologies.

    :abstractText: The substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) is a new type of guided wave structure fabricated with periodic metallic via holes in a multilayered LTCC substrate. The SIW takes the advantages of both waveguide and microstrip structures, like the high-Q factor, high power capacity, small size, and the possibility of integration. In this paper, the propagation characteristics of the SIW are investigated, based on a finite difference method by using appropriate absorbing boundary conditions. A special treatment has been made in the interaction of the incident wave with the SIW structure. Simulated results are given to test the validity and efficiency of the proposed method, from which very interesting phenomena have been found in the SIW.

Using the above method, the guided-wave problem is then converted to a generalized matrix eigenvalue problem and finally transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem, which can be easily solved with many efficient available subroutines. Excellent agreements of numerical simulations and experimental results show the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

    :abstractText: An iterative measured equation technique (IMET) is presented for a numerical solution of electromagnetic problems. This technique is an extension and improvement of the method of measured equation of invariance (MEI). In this technique, an iterative scheme is designed in such away that a new set of metrons used to generate the measured equations is formed in each iteration based on the solution of the previous iteration. The new metrons are more meaningful in that they converge to the physical quantity of interest such as the surface current density for electrodynamic problems and the surface charge density for electrostatic problems. The IMET offers several advantages over the MEI method because it requires only two mesh layers, resulting in a significant reduction in the memory requirement and computing time. More importantly, it provides a means for a systematic improvement of the accuracy of solution. The IMET is applied successfully to two-dimensional (2-D) electrodynamic and three-dimensional (3-D) electrostatic problems. Numerical results show that the technique is highly accurate and the iterative process converges very quickly, usually within two iterations

(see IEEE Trans. Antennas and Propag., vol. 39, p. 350-353, Mar. 1991), which introduced a numerically derived Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC) for the solution of open region scattering problems. In this paper, the idea was to present the unknown field or its derivative at a terminal node in terms of a weighted summation of neighboring nodes that lie in the interior. The weighting coefficients are solved for by representing the field at the terminal node in terms of a finite number of its spatial harmonics (three or five dominant harmonics). The concept was demonstrated by applying it to cylindrical harmonics in the context of the finite-element method, whereas the authors of the above paper considered planar waveguide harmonics in the context of the finite-difference method. The authors reply to this comment

    :abstractText: The numerical solution of the finite difference with the measured equation of invariance (FD-MEI) for transversally anisotropic cylinders is presented. It is different from the currently available methods for the anisotropic scatterers; this approach involves both the finite-difference equations at interior nodes of the mesh and the measured equation of invariance for the boundary nodes of the mesh. It has the merit of saving the computing time and computer memory needs. By introducing the novel nine-point mesh the generalized finite-difference equations for the inhomogeneous transversally anisotropic material are derived. The radar cross section (RCS) for inhomogeneous, lossy, electrically large, and arbitrarily shaped two-dimensional transversally anisotropic objects are calculated. The computing efficiency and accuracy are assessed using comparisons with two other methods, namely, the integral equation based on a plane wave representation of the fields and the combined field surface integral equations when available

    :abstractText: In this paper, a new capacitance extraction method called the dimension-reduction technique (DRT) is presented for three-dimensional (3-D) very large-scale integration (VLSI) interconnects. The DRT converts a complex 3-D problem into a series of cascading simple two-dimensional (2-D) problems. Each 2-D problem is solved separately, thus we can choose the most efficient method according to the arrangement of conductors. We have used the DRT to extract the capacitance matrix of multilayered and multiconductor crossovers, bends, vias with signal lines, and open-end. The results are in close agreement with those of Ansoft's SPICELINK and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) FastCap, but the computing time and memory size used by the DRT are several (even ten) times less than those used by SPICELINK and FastCap

Different subdomains are analyzed separately, so the most efficient method can be chosen for every subdomain. Therefore, the DDM can greatly reduce the algorithm complexity and provide a good platform for the development of combining methods. Numerical results show that the computing time and memory size used by the DDM are more than ten times less than those used by Ansoft's Maxwell SpiceLink-and more importantly, they are unrelated to the thickness of the pure dielectric layers

    :abstractText: In this paper, a generalized absorbing boundary condition (Z-ABCs) is constructed in the Z-transform domain. Based on Z-ABCs, some well-known ABCs, such as the Mur's ABC, the dispersive boundary condition, Zhao and Litva's ABC, Liao's ABC, etc. can be easily deduced. Besides, it can also result in some new ABCs. Recurrence formulas for the coefficients of Z-ABCs are presented, and the stability and numerical dispersive characteristics are discussed in detail. In order to validate the Z-ABCs, the finite-difference time-domain method is applied to the analysis of transmission lines, integrated filters, patch antennas, and scattering problems.

    :abstractText: Robotic swarm behavior is usually demonstrated using groups of robots, in which each robot in the swarm must possess full mobile capabilities, including the ability to control both forward and reverse motion as well as directional steering. Such requirements place severe constraints on the cost and size of the individual robots (swarmers), limiting the number of units and constraining the overall minimal size of a swarm. Here we show that similarly-complex swarm behavior can be achieved using much simpler individual swarmers. These possess significantly fewer controllable degrees of freedom, namely the ability to move forward at different velocities. We demonstrate how the interaction between different units then causes the entire swarm to obtain maneuverability unavailable at the individual level. These results may open the door to fabrication of simpler and smaller units for swarms allowing significantly larger numbers of units and smaller overall swarm footprints.

    :abstractText: "A new approach of integrating biological microorganisms such as bacteria to an inorganic robot body for propulsion in low velocity or stagnant flow field is proposed in this paper with the ultimate goal of fabricating a few hundreds of micrometer size swimming robots. To show the feasibility of this approach, Serratia marcescens bacteria are attached to microscale objects such as 10 micron polystyrene beads by blotting them in a bacteria swarm plate. Randomly attached bacteria are shown to propel the beads at an average speed of approximately 15 \xC2\xB5m/sec stochastically. Using chemical stimuli, bacteria flagellar propulsion is halted by introducing copper ions into the motility medium of the beads, while ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid is used to resume their motion. Thus, repeatable on/off motion control of the bacteria integrated mobile beads was shown. On-board chemical motion control, steering, wireless communication, sensing, and position detection are few of the future challenges for this work. Small or large numbers of these microrobots can potentially enable hardware platforms for self-organization, swarm intelligence, distributed control, and reconfigurable systems in the future."

The microrobot, which is composed of neodymium\xC3\xA2\xC2\x80\xC2\x94iron\xC3\xA2\xC2\x80\xC2\x94boron with dimensions 250 \xC3\x8E\xC2\xBCm 1 130 \xC3\x8E\xC2\xBCm 1 10 \xC3\x8E\xC2\xBCm , is actuated by a system of six macro-scale electromagnets. Periodically varying magnetic fields are used to impose magnetic torques, which induce stick\xC3\xA2\xC2\x80\xC2\x94slip motion in the micro-robot. These magnetic forces and torques are incorporated into a comprehensive dynamic model, which captures the behavior of the micro-robot. By pivoting the micro-robot about an edge, non-planar obstacles with characteristic sizes comparable to the robot length can be surmounted. Actuation is demonstrated on several substrates with different surface properties, in a fluid environment, and in a vacuum. Observed micro-robot translation speeds can exceed 10 mm s-1."

    :abstractText: "In this work, one-dimensional experimental teleoperated nanomanipulation with force and visual feedback is demonstrated by using an atomic force microscope on the slave side and a haptic device on the master side. Three main topics are addressed that are especially relevant for force feedback in teleoperation at the nanoscale: transparency, impedance reflection according to human perception and stability. To further assist the operator, the Maugis-Dugdale elastic contact mechanics model is utilized to provide an augmented reality visual interface. As a result, a robust platform to perform teleoperated nanomanipulation on a broad range of materials is achieved. The performance of the resulting system is demonstrated on experimental results for vertical tip positioning tasks on glass, polystyrene and silicone rubber substrates with force and visual feedback. Experimental results indicate that softer substrates yield higher positioning errors and lower reaching speeds. Finally, one-dimensional nanoindentation of a flat polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) surface using the proposed teleoperation system is demonstrated."

    :abstractText: A quadrupedal robot inspired by the basilisk lizard was developed and modeled with a 3-D real time simulation. Due to the robot's geometry, leg motion, and water interactions, the net pitch moment at the center of mass is not zero making pitch motion unstable. This paper introduces two types of tails, passive and active, to stabilize pitch motion and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each. It is shown in simulation that a purely passive tail can stabilize pitch motion and lead to a steady state robot pitch angle in the absence of disturbances. It is further shown that an active tail can compensate for disturbances and correct any drift in the robot body pitch angle due to changes in robot running speed.

    :abstractText: Atomic force microscope (AFM) based nanomanipulation systems are generally slow, not repeatable and imprecise due to a lack of control on the success of limited attempts in the literature. To improve the amount of control, reliability and precision of such systems, this work proposes an automated nanomanipulation method. Spherical gold nanoparticles with 100 nm diameter are positioned mechanically on a flat mica substrate by contact manipulation by the AFM probe tip to a desired position autonomously. The most significant issue of the manipulation operation is the lack of real-time visual feedback. This issue is solved by developing a robust algorithm for particle center detection and using the AFM cantilever deflection (force) signals to detect contact losses in real-time and to repeat the manipulation again until the target location is reached. Using these solutions, an automated AFM manipulation system is developed and a statistical study is made, where gold nanoparticles are positioned for 50 times to random target positions in different directions and pushing distances. 86% of all the particles could be successfully positioned to the target positions with an accuracy less than 100 nm. Unsuccessful positioning operations are due to the particle sticking to either the tip (8%) or the substrate (6%). Additionally, performance of the successful manipulations are investigated on 60 manipulation operations in 12 different directions and 5 different distances. The metrics used to quantify performance are the final particle position error and the average manipulation speed.

    :abstractText: "In recent years, flagellar motors of bacteria have not only inspired design of an entirely new category of microrobots, they have also been interfaced with synthetic components and used for controlled actuation of microscale objects. The ultimate goal of these efforts is to develop bio-hybrid swimming micro-robots which use bacteria for actuation, control, and sensing. As bacteria begin to become an integral part of microscale engineered systems, there is a great need for characterizing their performance and understanding the forces involved in interfacing them with synthetic components. In this work repeatability and endurance (performance as a function of time) of an ensemble of bacteria used for actuation of 10 \xC2\xB5m polystyrene micro-beads are characterized. Moreover, a series of adhesion assay methods are introduced and used to determine the strength and timeline of adhesion of Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) bacteria to hydrophobic and hydrophilic polystyrene surfaces."

    :abstractText: "A quadrupedal water runner robot inspired by the basilisk lizard has previously demonstrated the capability of water surface locomotion. Since the robot is aimed for the amphibious locomotion, a compatible design on both ground and water surface is discussed in this paper. A compliant footpad which can transfer elastic energy to propulsive momentum is introduced and modeled using a pseudo-rigid-body model. Dynamic modeling of the footpad and the robot provides a criterion of efficient ground locomotion. For the water surface locomotion, drag force can be reduced by compliance of the footpad. The optimized design taking into account two locomotions is studied and analyzed for stability using the Poincar\xC3\xA9 map."

Multiple Mag-\xC2\xB5Bot control is enabled by employing an array of individually addressable electrostatic surfaces to selectively anchor individual Mag-\xC2\xB5Bots. Coupled parallel and uncoupled serial motion of multiple robots is demonstrated, and they can combine to form an assembly that is also capable of motion. Manipulation of 230 \xC2\xB5m diameter microspheres is also demonstrated cooperatively by two Mag-\xC2\xB5Bots in a fluid environment, and is enhanced when the two Mag-\xC2\xB5Bots are combined.

    :abstractText: Tankbot is a miniature, energy efficient, lightweight (60 g), and robust climbing robot. It uses the continuous detachment force (peeling) of the flat, bulk tacky elastomer tread to climb. An optimum peeling angle with a preliminary analysis of the pretension effect, and the tread force distributions are presented. A passive tail transfers the peeling force from the rear wheel to the front and ensures intimate continuous contact with the surface. Tankbot works in any orientation on smooth surfaces, such as glass and acrylic, of all slope angles (0 - 360 degrees). However, the robot can only work vertically on relatively rough surfaces in any direction, such as wood, metal, painted wall, and painted brick. Tankbot can carry a payload of up to 40 g and 100 g on inverted and vertical surfaces, respectively. In addition, the robot can go over obstacles up to 15 mm tall on smooth vertical surfaces. Internal transitioning from horizontal to vertical and vertical to horizontal and external transitioning from vertical to the horizontal are also achieved. The potential applications of this robot include inspection, exploration, maintenance, cleaning, repair, and search and rescue.

    :abstractText: In this paper, the design, analysis, and development of a sixteen-legged palm-sized climbing robot using flat bulk tacky elastomer adhesives as an attachment method is presented. A legged robot with four-bar based kinematics is designed and fabricated with elastomeric footpads. The proposed robot has a passive peeling mechanism for energy efficient and vibration free detachment. A rocker-type mechanism in the leg and compliant foam under the footpads are utilized for passive alignment on concave and convex surfaces. Adhesion experimental data is used to estimate the adhesion and preload saturation on the footpads on different angled acrylic surface. It is showed that although the initial preload does not affect the adhesion and preload saturation point, the orientation and the weight of the robot, roughness of the surface, and waiting time between consecutive steps greatly effect the climbing performance. Experimental results revealed that the robot can climb in any direction in 3D space on smooth surfaces, such as acrylic and glass. It can carry a payload of up to 2 N, which is almost twice as its own weight, on a smooth inverted surface. The robot can robustly climb vertically on relatively rough surfaces such as a painted wall or a wooden door. Potential applications of this robot include inspection, exploration, maintenance, cleaning, repair, and search and rescue.

    :abstractText: In this paper, flat elastomers are proposed as an attachment material for climbing robots on less than a few micrometer-scale rough surfaces due to their energy-efficient, quiet, and residue-free characteristics. The proper elastomer is chosen by the use of the current adhesion, friction, and peeling elastomer-contact-mechanics models. Then, adhesion and friction properties of the chosen dry flat-elastomer thick films (Vytaflex-10) are characterized on acrylic and smooth and rough glass surfaces for variations in preloads, speeds, contact times, and elastomer thicknesses. A climbing robot with four-bar-based legged-body kinematics is designed and fabricated as simple and lightweight as possible to demonstrate the feasibility of the elastomers as attachment materials on relatively smooth surfaces. The robot utilizes a passive alignment system to make the footpads parallel to the surface on light contact, a peeling mechanism to minimize the detachment vibration, and a passive tail to minimize the pitch-back moment. Experimental results showed that the robot can climb stably on vertical, smooth surfaces in any direction and can walk inverted for a limited amount of time.

    :abstractText: "We present approximation algorithms for the unsplittable flow problem (UFP) in undirected graphs. As is standard in this line of research, we assume that the maximum demand is at most the minimum capacity. We focus on the non-uniform capacity case in which the edge capacities can vary arbitrarily over the graph. Our results are: We obtain an $O({\\Delta}\\alpha^{-1} \\log^2 n)$ approximation ratio for UFP, where n is the number of vertices, ${\\Delta}$ is the maximum degree, and $\\alpha$ is the expansion of the graph. Furthermore, if we specialize to the case where all edges have the same capacity, our algorithm gives an $O({\\Delta} \\alpha^{-1} \\log n)$ approximation. For certain strong constant-degree expanders considered by Frieze [17] we obtain an $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ approximation for the uniform capacity case. For UFP on the line and the ring, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithms. All of the above results improve if the maximum demand is bounded away from the minimum capacity. The above results either improve upon or are incomparable with previously known results for these problems. The main technique used for these results is randomized rounding followed by greedy alteration, and is inspired by the use of this idea in recent work."

    :abstractText: We consider a single-source network design problem from a game-theoretic perspective. Gupta, Kumar and Roughgarden (Proc. 35th&#x00a0;Annual ACM STOC, pp.&#x00a0;365&#x2013;372, 2003) developed a simple method for a single-source rent-or-buy problem that also yields the best-known approximation ratio for the problem. We show how to use a variant of this method to develop an approximately budget-balanced and group strategyproof cost-sharing method for the problem. The novelty of our approach stems from our obtaining the cost-sharing methods for the rent-or-buy problem by carefully combining cost-shares for the simpler Steiner tree problem. Our algorithm is conceptually simpler than the previous such cost-sharing method due to P&#x00e1;l and Tardos (Proc. 44th&#x00a0;Annual FOCS, pp.&#x00a0;584&#x2013;593, 2003), and improves the previously-known approximation factor of 15 to&#x00a0;4.6.

    :abstractText: "We study the Steiner Tree problem in the model of two-stage stochastic optimization with non-uniform inflation factors, and give a poly-logarithmic approximation factor for this problem. In this problem, we are given a graph G = (V,E), with each edge having two costs c M and c T (the costs for Monday and Tuesday, respectively). We are also given a probability distribution \xC2\xBF: 2 V \xC2\xBF[0,1] over subsets of V, and will be given a client set S drawn from this distribution on Tuesday. The algorithm has to buy a set of edges E M on Monday, and after the client set S is revealed on Tuesday, it has to buy a (possibly empty) set of edges E T (S) so that the edges in E M \xC2\xBF E T (S) connect all the nodes in S. The goal is to minimize the c M (E M ) + E S \xC2\xBF\xC2\xBF [ c T ( E T (S) ) ].We give the first poly-logarithmic approximation algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm builds on the recent techniques developed by Chekuri et al. (FOCS 2006) for multi-commodity Cost-Distance. Previously, the problem had been studied for the cases when c T = \xC2\xBF\xC3\x97c M for some constant \xC2\xBF \xC2\xBF 1 (i.e., the uniform case), or for the case when the goal was to find a tree spanning all the vertices but Tuesday's costs were drawn from a given distribution $\\widehat{\\pi}$ (the so-called \"stochastic MST case\").We complement our results by showing that our problem is at least as hard as the single-sink Cost-Distance problem (which is known to be \xC2\xBF(loglogn) hard). Moreover, the requirement that Tuesday's costs are fixed seems essential: if we allow Tuesday's costs to dependent on the scenario as in stochastic MST, the problem becomes as hard as Label Cover (which is $\\Omega(2^{\\log^{1-\\varepsilon} n})$-hard). As an aside, we also give an LP-rounding algorithm for the multi-commodity Cost-Distance problem, matching the O(log4 n) approximation guarantee given by Chekuri et al. (FOCS 2006)."

    :abstractText: "Given a metric (V,d), a spanner is a sparse graph whose shortest-path metric approximates the distance d to within a small multiplicative distortion. In this paper, we study the problem of spanners with slack: e.g., can we find sparse spanners where we are allowed to incur an arbitrarily large distortion on a small constant fraction of the distances, but are then required to incur only a constant (independent of n) distortion on the remaining distances? We answer this question in the affirmative, thus complementing similar recent results on embeddings with slack into lp spaces. For instance, we show that if we ignore an e fraction of the distances, we can get spanners with O(n) edges and O(log 1/\xCE\xB5) distortion for the remaining distances. We also show how to obtain sparse and low-weight spanners with slack from existing constructions of conventional spanners, and these techniques allow us to also obtain the best known results for distance oracles and distance labelings with slack. This paper complements similar results obtained in recent research on slack embeddings into normed metric spaces."

    :abstractText: Consider the following network subscription pricing problem. We are given a graph G = (V,E) with a root r, and potential customers are companies headquartered at r with locations at a subset of nodes. Every customer requires a network connecting its locations to r. The network provider can build this network with a combination of backbone edges (consisting of high capacity cables) that can route any subset of the customers, and access edges that can route only a single customer's traffic. The backbone edges cost M times that of the access edges. Our goal is to devise a group-strategyproof pricing mechanism for the network provider, i.e., one in which truth-telling is the optimal strategy for the customers, even in the presence of coalitions. We give a pricing mechanism that is 2-competitive and O(1)-budget-balanced. As a means to obtaining this pricing mechanism, we present the first primal-dual 8-approximation algorithm for this problem. Since the two-stage Stochastic Steiner tree problem can be reduced to the underlying network design, we get a primal-dual algorithm for the stochastic problem as well. Finally, as a byproduct of our techniques, we also provide bounds on the inefficiency of our mechanism.

    :abstractText: "The k-forest problem is a common generalization of both the k-MST and the dense-k-subgraph problems. Formally, given a metric space on n vertices V, with m demand pairs \xE2\x8A\x86 V \xC3\x97 V and a \"target\" k \xE2\x89\xA4 m, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connects at least k demand pairs. In this paper, we give an O(min{\xE2\x88\x9An,\xE2\x88\x9Ak})- approximation algorithm for k-forest, improving on the previous best ratio of O(min{n2/3,\xE2\x88\x9Am} log n) by Segev and Segev [20]. We then apply our algorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given an n point metric space with m objects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most k objects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination. We prove that an a-approximation algorithm for the k-forest problem implies an O(\xCE\xB1\xC4\x8Blog2 n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our results for k-forest, we get an O(min{\xE2\x88\x9An,\xE2\x88\x9Ak}\xC4\x8Blog2 n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for Dial-a-Ride was an O(\xE2\x88\x9Ak log n)-approximation by Charikar and Raghavachari [5]; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation guarantee-- in fact, when the vehicle capacity k is large, we give a slight improvement on their results. The reduction from Dial-a-Ride to the k-forest problem is fairly robust, and allows us to obtain approximation algorithms (with the same guarantee) for the following generalizations: (i) Non-uniform Dial-a-Ride, where the cost of traversing each edge is an arbitrary nondecreasing function of the number of objects in the vehicle; and (ii) Weighted Diala-Ride, where demands are allowed to have different weights. The reduction is essential, as it is unclear how to extend the techniques of Charikar and Raghavachari to these Dial-a-Ride generalizations."

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of embedding finite metrics with slack: we seek to produce embeddings with small dimension and distortion while allowing a (small) constant fraction of all distances to be arbitrarily distorted. This definition is motivated by recent research in the networking community, which achieved striking empirical success at embedding Internet latencies with low distortion into low-dimensional Euclidean space, provided that some small slack is allowed. Answering an open question of Kleinberg, Slivkins, and Wexler [29], we show that provable guarantees of this type can in fact be achieved in general: any finite metric can be embedded, with constant slack and constant distortion, into constant-dimensional Euclidean space. We then show that there exist stronger embeddings into \\ell 1 which exhibit gracefully degrading distortion: these is a single embedding into \\ell 1 that achieves distortion at most O(\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon }) on allbut at most an \\varepsilon fraction of distances, simultaneously for all \\varepsilon > 0. We extend this with distortion O(\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon })to maps into general \\ell p, p\\ge 1 for several classes of metrics, including those with bounded doubling dimension and those arising from the shortest-path metric of a graph with an excluded minor. Finally, we show that many of our constructions are tight, and give a general technique to obtain lower bounds for \\varepsilon-slack embeddings from lower bounds for low-distortion embeddings."

    :abstractText: The study of the effect of priced information on basic algorithmic problems was initiated by the paper of Charikar et al. [5]. In this paper, we continue the study of sorting and selection in the priced comparison model, i.e., when each comparison has an associated cost, and answer some of the open problems suggested by [5]. If the comparison costs are allowed to be arbitrary, we show that one can not get good approximation ratios. A different way to assign costs is based on the idea that one can distill out an intrinsic value for each item being compared such that the cost of comparing two elements is some "well-behaved" or "structured" function of their values. We feel that most practical applications will have some structured cost property.In this paper, we study the problems of sorting and selection (which includes finding the maximum and the median) in the structured cost model. We get a variety of approximation results for these problems, depending on the restrictions we put on the structured costs. We show that it is possible to get much improved results with the structured cost model than the case when we do not have any assumptions on comparison costs.

    :abstractText: The doubling constant of a metric space (X, d) is the smallest value \lambda such that every ball in X can be covered by \lambda balls of half the radius. The doubling dimension of X is then defined as \dim (X) = \log _2 \lambda. A metric (or sequence of metrics) is called doubling precisely when its doubling dimension is bounded. This is a robust class of metric spaces which contains many families of metrics that occur in applied settings.We give tight bounds for embedding doubling metrics into (low-dimensional) normed spaces. We consider both general doubling metrics, as well as more restricted families such as those arising from trees, from graphs excluding a fixed minor, and from snowflaked metrics. Our techniques include decomposition theorems for doubling metrics, and an analysis of a fractal in the plane due to Laakso [21]. Finally, we discuss some applications and point out a centralopen question regarding dimensionality reduction in L2.

    :abstractText: "We study the multicommodity rent-or-buy problem, a type of network design problem with economies of scale. In this problem, capacity on an edge can be rented, with cost incurred on a per-unit of capacity basis, or bought, which allows unlimited use after payment of a large fixed cost. Given a graph and a set of source-sink pairs, we seek a minimum-cost way of installing sufficient capacity on edges so that a prescribed amount of flow can be sent simultaneously from each source to the corresponding sink. The first constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem was recently given by Kumar et al. (FOCS '02); however, this algorithm and its analysis are both quite complicated, and its performance guarantee is extremely large.In this paper, we give a conceptually simple 12-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our analysis of this algorithm makes crucial use of cost sharing, the task of allocating the cost of an object to many users of the object in a \"fair\" manner. While techniques from approximation algorithms have recently yielded new progress on cost sharing problems, our work is the first to show the converse \xC2\xBF that ideas from cost sharing can be fruitfully applied in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms."

    :abstractText: "A new packet routing model proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force is MultiProtocol Label Switching, or MPLS [B. Davie and Y. Rekhter, MPLS: Technology and Applications, Morgan Kaufmann (Elsevier), New York, 2000]. Instead of each router's parsing the packet network layer header and doing its lookups based on that analysis (as in much of conventional packet routing), MPLS ensures that the analysis of the header is performed just once. The packet is then assigned a stack of labels, where the labels are usually much smaller than the packet headers themselves. When a router receives a packet, it examines the label at the top of the label stack and makes the decision of where the packet is forwarded based solely on that label. It can pop the top label off the stack if it so desires, and can also push some new labels onto the stack, before forwarding the packet. This scheme has several advantages over conventional routing protocols, the two primary ones being (a) reduced amount of header analysis at intermediate routers, which allows for faster switching times, and (b) better traffic engineering capabilities and hence easier handling of quality of service issues. However, essentially nothing is known at a theoretical level about the performance one can achieve with this protocol, or about the intrinsic trade-offs in its use of resources.This paper initiates a theoretical study of MPLS protocols, and routing algorithms and lower bounds are given for a variety of situations. We first study the routing problem on the line, a case which is already nontrivial, and give routing protocols whose trade-offs are close to optimality. We then extend our results for paths to trees, and thence onto more general graphs. These routing algorithms on general graphs are obtained by finding a tree cover of a graph, i.e., a small family of subtrees of the graph such that, for each pair of vertices, one of the trees in the family contains an (almost-)shortest path between them. Our results show tree covers of logarithmic size for planar graphs and graphs with bounded separators, which may be of independent interest."

    :abstractText: Real-world networks often need to be designed under uncertainty, with only partial information and predictions of demand available at the outset of the design process. The field of stochastic optimization deals with such problems where the forecasts are specified in terms of probability distributions of future data. In this paper, we broaden the set of models as well as the techniques being considered for approximating stochastic optimization problems. For example, we look at stochastic models where the cost of the elements is correlated to the set of realized demands, and risk-averse models where upper bounds are placed on the amount spent in each of the stages. These generalized models require new techniques, and our solutions are based on a novel combination of the primal-dual method truncated based on optimal LP relaxation values, followed by a tree-rounding stage. We use these to give constant-factor approximation algorithms for the stochastic Steiner tree and single sink network design problems in these generalized models.

    :abstractText: We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for network design with multiple commodities and economies of scale. We consider the rent-or-buy problem, a type of multicommodity buy-at-bulk network design in which there are two ways to install capacity on any given edge. Capacity can be rented, with cost incurred on a per-unit of capacity basis, or bought, which allows unlimited use after payment of a large fixed cost. Given a graph and a set of source-sink pairs, we seek a minimum-cost way of installing sufficient capacity on edges so that a prescribed amount of flow can be sent simultaneously from each source to the corresponding sink.Recent work on buy-at-bulk network design has concentrated on the special case where all sinks are identical; existing constant-factor approximation algorithms for this special case make crucial use of the assumption that all commodities ship flow to the same sink vertex and do not obviously extend to the multicommodity rent-or-buy problem. Prior to our work, the best heuristics for the multicommodity rent-or-buy problem achieved only logarithmic performance guarantees and relied on the machinery of relaxed metrical task systems or of metric embeddings. By contrast, we solve the network design problem directly via a novel primal-dual algorithm.

The aim is finding a mapping such that the cost of $\\MAP(X)$ is as close as possible to the optimal set-cover cost for $X$. (Such problems are also called \\emph{oblivious} or \\emph{a-priori} optimization problems.) Unfortunately, for every universal mapping, the cost of $\\MAP(X)$ can be $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ times larger than optimal if the set $X$ is adversarially chosen.In this paper we study the \\emph{performance on average}, when $X$ is a set of randomly chosen elements from the universe: we show how to efficiently find a universal map whose expected cost is $O(\\log mn)$ times the expected optimal cost. In fact, we give a slightly improved analysis and show that this is the best possible.We generalize these ideas to weighted set cover and show similar guarantees to (non-metric) facility location, where we have to balance the facility opening cost with the cost of connecting clients to the facilities. We show applications of our results to universal multi-cut and disc-covering problems, and show how all these universal mappings give us \\emph{stochastic online algorithms} with the same competitive factors."

A feasible solution to the problem is a set of edges E t for each t connecting D t to r. Instead of obtaining edges for a single day at a time, or for infinitely long (both of which give Steiner tree problems), we lease edges for say, { a day, a week, a month, a year }. Naturally, leasing an edge for a longer period costs less per unit of time. What is a good leasing strategy? In this paper, we give a general approach to solving a wide class of such problems by showing a close connection between deterministic leasing problems and problems in multistage stochastic optimization. All our results are in the offline setting."

    :abstractText: "In recent years, considerable advances have been made in the study of properties of metric spaces in terms of their doubling dimension. This line of research has not only enhanced our understanding of finite metrics, but has also resulted in many algorithmic applications. However, we still do not understand the interaction between various graphtheoretic (topological) properties of graphs, and the doubling (geometric) properties of the shortest-path metrics induced by them. For instance, the following natural question suggests itself: given a finite doubling metric (V, d), is there always an unweighted graph (V\xE2\x80\xB2,E\xE2\x80\xB2) with V \xE2\x8A\x86 V\xE2\x80\xB2 such that the shortest path metric d\xE2\x80\xB2 on V\xE2\x80\xB2 is still doubling, and which agrees with d on V. This is often useful, given that unweighted graphs are often easier to reason about. A first hurdle to answering this question is that subdividing edges can increase the doubling dimension unboundedly, and it is not difficult to show that the answer to the above question is negative. However, surprisingly, allowing a (1 + \xC6\x9D) distortion between d and d\xE2\x80\xB2 enables us bypass this impossibility: we show that for any metric space (V, d), there is an unweighted graph (V\xE2\x80\xB2, E\xE2\x80\xB2) with shortest-path metric d\xE2\x80\xB2 : V\xE2\x80\xB2 \xC3\x97 V\xE2\x80\xB2 \xE2\x86\x92 R\xE2\x89\xA50 such that - for all x, y \xE2\x88\x88 V , the distances d(x, y) \xE2\x89\xA4 d\xE2\x80\xB2(x, y) \xE2\x89\xA4 (1 + \xC6\x9D) \xC4\x8B d(x, y), and - the doubling dimension for d\xE2\x80\xB2 is not much more than that of d, where this change depends only on \xC6\x9D and not on the size of the graph. We show a similar result when both (V, d) and (V\xE2\x80\xB2, E\xE2\x80\xB2) are restricted to be trees: this gives a simple proof that doubling trees embed into constant dimensional Euclidean space with constant distortion. We also show that our results are tight in terms of the tradeoff between distortion and dimension blowup."

    :abstractText: A quorum system over a universe of logical elements is a collection of subsets (quorums) of elements, any two of which intersect. In numerous distributed algorithms, the elements of the universe reside on the nodes of a physical network and the participating nodes access the system by contacting every element in some quorum, potentially causing the added network congestion induced by these quorum accesses to play a limiting factor in the performance of the algorithm.In this paper we initiate the study of algorithms to place universe elements on the nodes of a physical network so as to minimize the network congestion that results from quorum accesses, while also ensuring that no physical node is overloaded by access requests from clients. We consider two models, one in which communication routes can be chosen arbitrarily and one in which they are fixed in advance. We show that in either model, the optimal congestion (with respect to the load constraints) cannot be approximated to any factor (unless P=NP). However, we show that at most doubling the load on nodes allows us to achieve a congestion that is close to this optimal value. We also shed some light on the extent to which element migration can reduce congestion in this context.

    :abstractText: A quorum system is a family of sets (themselves called quorums), each pair of which intersect. In many distributed algorithms, the basic unit accessed by a client is a quorum of nodes. Such algorithms are used for applications such as mutual exclusion, data replication, and dissemination of information. However, accessing spread-out quorums causes access delays that we would like to minimize. Furthermore, every member of the quorum incurs processing load to handle quorum accesses by clients.In this paper we study the problem of placing quorums in a physical network so as to minimize the delay that clients incur by accessing quorums, and while respecting each physical node's capacity (in terms of the load of client requests it can handle). We provide approximation algorithms for this problem for two natural measures of delay (the max-delay and total-delay). All our algorithms ensure that each node's load is within a constant factor of its capacity, and minimize delay to within a constant factor of the optimal delay for all capacity-respecting solutions. We also provide better approximations for several well-known quorum systems.

Among other results, we give an O(&radic;n)-approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a line embedding of a metric induced by a given unweighted graph, that minimizes the (standard) multiplicative distortion. We give an improved &Otilde;(n1/3) approximation for the case of metrics generated by unweighted trees. This is the first result of this type.

    :abstractText: We study the problem of routing in doubling metrics, and show how to perform hierarchical routing in such metrics with small stretch and compact routing tables (i.e., with small amount of routing information stored at each vertex). We say that a metric (X, d) has doubling dimension dim(X) at most &alpha; if every set of diameter D can be covered by 2&alpha; sets of diameter D/2. (A doubling metric is one whose doubling dimension dim(X) is a constant.) We show how to perform (1 + &tau;)-stretch routing on metrics for any 0 < T &le; 1 with routing tables of size at most (&alpha;/&tau;)O(&alpha;) log2 &Delta; bits with only (&alpha;/&tau;)O(&alpha;) log &Delta; entries, where &Delta; is the diameter of the graph; hence the number of routing table entries is just &tau;-O(1) log &Delta; for doubling metrics. These results extend and improve on those of Talwar (2004).We also give better constructions of sparse spanners for doubling metrics than those obtained from the routing tables above; for &tau; > 0, we give algorithms to construct (1 + &tau;)-stretch spanners for a metric (X, d) with maximum degree at most (2 + 1/&tau;)O(dim(X)), matching the results of Das et al. for Euclidean metrics.

We show how to embed n-point negative-type metrics into Euclidean space &ell;2 with distortion D &equals; O(log3/4n). This embedding result, in turn, implies an O(log3/4k)-approximation algorithm for the Sparsest Cut problem with nonuniform demands. Another corollary we obtain is that n-point subsets of &ell;1 embed into &ell;2 with distortion O(log3/4 n).

    :abstractText: We show that the shortest-path metric of any $k$-outerplanar graph, for any fixed $k$, can be approximated by a probability distribution over tree metrics with constant distortion and hence also embedded into $\ell_1$ with constant distortion. These graphs play a central role in polynomial time approximation schemes for many NP-hard optimization problems on general planar graphs and include the family of weighted $k\times n$ planar grids. This result implies a constant upper bound on the ratio between the sparsest cut and the maximum concurrent flow in multicommodity networks for $k$-outerplanar graphs, thus extending a theorem of Okamura and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 31 (1981), pp. 75-81] for outerplanar graphs, and a result of Gupta et al. [Combinatorica, 24 (2004), pp. 233-269] for treewidth-2 graphs. In addition, we obtain improved approximation ratios for $k$-outerplanar graphs on various problems for which approximation algorithms are based on probabilistic tree embeddings. We conjecture that these embeddings for $k$-outerplanar graphs may serve as building blocks for $\ell_1$ embeddings of more general metrics.

    :abstractText: "Consider the following classical network design problem: a set of terminals T &equals; &lcub;ti&rcub; wishes to send traffic to a root r in an n-node graph G &equals; (V, E). Each terminal ti sends di units of traffic and enough bandwidth has to be allocated on the edges to permit this. However, bandwidth on an edge e can only be allocated in integral multiples of some base capacity ue and hence provisioning k &times; ue bandwidth on edge e incurs a cost of &lceil;k&rceil; times the cost of that edge. The objective is a minimum-cost feasible solution. This is one of many network design problems widely studied where the bandwidth allocation is governed by side constraints: edges can only allow a subset of cables to be purchased on them or certain quality-of-service requirements may have to be met. In this work, we show that this problem and, in fact, several basic problems in this general network design framework cannot be approximated better than &Omega;(log log n) unless NP &sube; DTIME (nO(log log log n)), where &verbar;V&verbar; &equals; n. In particular, we show that this inapproximability threshold holds for (i) the Priority-Steiner Tree problem, (ii) the (single-sink) Cost-Distance problem, and (iii) the single-sink version of an even more fundamental problem, Fixed Charge Network Flow. Our results provide a further breakthrough in the understanding of the level of complexity of network design problems. These are the first nonconstant hardness results known for all these problems."

    :abstractText: "Over the past decade, numerous algorithms have been developed using the fact that the distances in any n-point metric (V, d) can be approximated to within O(log n) by distributions D over trees on the point set V [3, 10]. However, when the metric (V, d) is the shortest-path metric of an edge weighted graph G = (V, E), a natural requirement is to obtain such a result where the support of the distribution D is only over subtrees of G. For a long time, the best result satisfying this stronger requirement was a exp {&radic;log n log log n} distortion result of Alon et al. [1]. In a recent breakthrough, Elkin et al. [9] improved the distortion to O(log2 n log log n). (The best lower bound on the distortion is &Omega;(log n), say, for the n-vertex grid [1].)In this paper, we give a construction that improves the distortion to O(log2 n), improving slightly on the EEST construction. The main contribution of this paper is in the analysis: we use an algorithm which is similar to one used by EEST to give a distortion of O(log3 n), but using a new probabilistic analysis, we eliminate one of the logarithmic factors. The ideas and techniques we use to obtain this logarithmic improvement seem orthogonal to those used earlier in such situations---e.g., Seymour's decomposition scheme [4, 9] or the cutting procedures of CKR/FRT [5, 10], both which do not seem to give a guarantee of better than O(log2 n log log n) for this problem. We hope that our ideas (perhaps in conjunction with some of these others) will ultimately lead to an O(log n) distortion embedding of graph metrics into distributions over their spanning trees."

The shortest-path distance according to the edge-weights defines a metric dT on the vertex set V. We now ask the following question: Is it possible to define another weighted tree T* = (R, E*, w* : E* &rarrtl; R+), this time on just the red vertices so that the shortest-path metric dT* induced by T* on the vertices in R is &ldquo;close&rdquo; to the metric dT restricted to the red vertices? I.e., does there exist a weighted tree T* = (R, E*, c*) and a (small) constant &agr; such that dT(u, v) &le; dT* (u, v) &le; &agr; dT(u, v) for any two red vertices u, v &isin; R? We answer this question in the affirmative, and give a linear time algorithm to obtain a tree T* with &agr; &le; 8. We also give two applications of this result: an upper bound, in which we show that emulating multicasts using unicasts can be almost as good as general multicasts for certain performance measures; and a lower bound, in which we give a simple combinatorial proof of the fact that the metric generated by a graph of girthg must suffer a distortion of at least &OHgr;(g) when approximated by a tree."

    :abstractText: "Consider the following network design problem: given a network G = (V, E), source-sink pairs {si, ti} arrive and desire to send a unit of flow between themselves. The cost of the routing is this: if edge e carries a total of fe flow (from all the terminal pairs), the cost is given by &Sigma; el(fe), where l is some concave cost function; the goal is to minimize the total cost incurred. However, we want the routing to be oblivious: when terminal pair {si, ti} makes its routing decisions, it does not know the current flow on the edges of the network, nor the identity of the other pairs in the system. Moreover, it does not even know the identity of the function l, merely knowing that l is a concave function of the total flow on the edge. How should it (obliviously) route its one unit of flow? Can we get competitive algorithms for this problem?In this paper, we develop a framework to model oblivious network design problems (of which the above problem is a special case), and give algorithms with poly-logarithmic competitive ratio for problems in this framework (and hence for this problem). Abstractly, given a problem like the one above, the solution is a multicommodity flow producing a \"load\" on each edge of Le = l(f1(e),f2(e), ..., fk(e)), and the total cost is given by an \"aggregation function\" agg (Le1,...,Lem) of the loads of all edges. Our goal is to develop oblivious algorithms that approximately minimize the total cost of the routing, knowing the aggregation function agg, but merely knowing that l lies in some class C, and having no other information about the current state of the network. Hence we want algorithms that are simultaneously \"function-oblivious\" as well as \"traffic-oblivious\".The aggregation functions we consider are the max and &sigma; objective functions, which correspond to the well-known measures of congestion and total cost of a network; in this paper, we prove the following:&bull; If the aggregation function is &Sigma;, we give an oblivious algorithm with O(log2 n) competitive ratio whenever the load function l is in the class of monotone sub-additive functions. (Recall that our algorithm is also \"function-oblivious\"; it works whenever each edge has a load function l in the class.)&bull; For the case when the aggregation function is max, we give an oblivious algorithm with O(log2 n log log n) competitive ratio, when the load function l is a norm; we also show that such a competitive ratio is not possible for general sub-additive functions.These are the first such general results about oblivious algorithms for network design problems, and we hope the ideas and techniques will lead to more and improved results in this area."

    :abstractText: "The UNIQUE GAMES problem is the following: we are given a graph G = (V, E), with each edge e = (u, v) having a weight we and a permutation &pi;uv on [k]. The objective is to find a labeling of each vertex u with a label fu &isin; [k] to minimize the weight of unsatisfied edges---where an edge (u, v) is satisfied if fv = &pi;uv(fu).The Unique Games Conjecture of Khot [8] essentially says that for each &epsilon; > 0, there is a k such that it is NP-hard to distinguish instances of Unique games with (1-&epsilon;) satisfiable edges from those with only &epsilon; satisfiable edges. Several hardness results have recently been proved based on this assumption, including optimal ones for Max-Cut, Vertex-Cover and other problems, making it an important challenge to prove or refute the conjecture.In this paper, we give an O(log n)-approximation algorithm for the problem of minimizing the number of unsatisfied edges in any Unique game. Previous results of Khot [8] and Trevisan [12] imply that if the optimal solution has OPT = &epsilon;m unsatisfied edges, semidefinite relaxations of the problem could give labelings with min {k2&epsilon;1/5, (&epsilon; log n)1/2}m unsatisfied edges. In this paper we show how to round a LP relaxation to get an O(log n)-approximation to the problem; i.e., to find a labeling with only O(&epsilon;m log n) = O(OPT log n) unsatisfied edges."

    :abstractText: "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a canonical NP-complete problem which is known to be MAX-SNP hard even on (high-dimensional) Euclidean metrics [39]. In order to circumvent this hardness, researchers have been developing approximation schemes for low-dimensional metrics [4, 38] (under different notions of dimension). However, a feature of most current notions of metric dimension is that they are \"local\": the definitions require every local neighborhood to be well-behaved. In this paper, we consider the case when the metric is less restricted: it has a few \"dense\" regions, but is \"well-behaved on the average\"? To this end, we define a global notion of dimension which we call the correlation dimension (denoted by dimC), which generalizes the popular notion of doubling dimension. In fact, the class of metrics with dimC = O(1) not only contains all doubling metrics, but also contains some metrics containing uniform submetrics of size &radic;n. We first show, using a somewhat \"local\" argument, that one can solve TSP on these metrics in time 2O(&radic;n); we then take advantage of the global nature of TSP (and the global nature of our definition) to give a (1 + &epsilon;)-approximation algorithm that runs in sub-exponential time: i.e., in 2O(n&delta;&epsilon;-4dimC)-time for every constant 0 < &delta; < 1."

While this model has been studied for online problems like paging and k-server, it is not known how to beat the &Phi;(log n) bound for online Steiner tree if at each time instant, the demand vertex is a uniformly random vertex from the graph. For the online Steiner tree problem, we show that if each demand vertex is an independent draw from some probability distribution &pi;: V &rarr; [0, 1], a variant of the natural greedy algorithm achieves E&omega;[A(&omega;)]/E&omega;[OPT (&omega;)] = O(1); moreover, this result can be extended to some other subadditive problems. Both assumptions that the input sequence consists of independent draws from &pi;, and that &pi; is known to the algorithm are both essential; we show (almost) logarithmic lower bounds if either assumption is violated. Moreover, we give preliminary results on extending the Steiner tree results above to the related \"expected ratio\" measure E&omega;[&omega;(&omega;)/OPT (&omega;)]. Finally, we use these ideas to give an average-case analysis of the Universal TSP problem."

    :abstractText: In the generalized connectivity problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph G = (V, E) and a collection D = {(S1,T1),&hellip;, (Sk,Tk)} of distinct demands; each demand (Si, Ti) is a pair of disjoint vertex subsets. We say that a subgraph F &sube; G connects a demand (Si, Ti) when it contains a path with one endpoint in Si and the other in Ti. The goal is to identify a minimum weight subgraph that connects all demands in D. Alon et al. (SODA '04) introduced this problem to study online network formation settings and showed that it captures some well-studied problems such as Steiner forest, non-metric facility location, tree multicast, and group Steiner tree. Finding a non-trivial approximation ratio for generalized connectivity was left as an open problem. Our starting point is the first polylogarithmic approximation for generalized connectivity attaining a performance guarantee of O(log2 n log2 k). Here n is the number of vertices in G and k is the number of demands. We also prove that the cut-covering relaxation of this problem has an O(log3 n log2 k) integrality gap. Building upon the results for generalized connectivity we obtain improved approximation algorithms for two problems that contain generalized connectivity as a special case. For the directed Steiner network problem, we obtain an O(k1/2+&epsilon;) approximation, which improves on the currently best performance guarantee of O(k2/3) due to Charikar et al. (SODA '98). For the set connector problem, recently introduced by Fukunaga and Nagamochi (IPCO '07), we present a polylogarithmic approximation; this result improves on the previously known ratio which can be &Omega;(n) in the worst case.

    :abstractText: "In an instance of the prize-collecting Steiner forest problem (PCSF) we are given an undirected graph G = (V, E), non-negative edge-costs c(e) for all e &epsilon; E, terminal pairs R = {(si, ti)}1&le;i&le;k, and penalties &pi;1,...,&pi;k. A feasible solution (F, Q) consists of a forest F and a subset Q of terminal pairs such that for all (si, ti) &epsilon; R either si, ti are connected by F or (si, ti) &epsilon; Q. The objective is to compute a feasible solution of minimum cost c(F) + &pi; (Q). A game-theoretic version of the above problem has k players, one for each terminal-pair in R. Player i's ultimate goal is to connect si and ti, and the player derives a privately held utility ui &ge; 0 from being connected. A service provider can connect the terminals si and ti of player i in two ways: (1) by buying the edges of an si, ti-path in G, or (2) by buying an alternate connection between si and ti (maybe from some other provider) at a cost of &pi;i. In this paper, we present a simple 3-budget-balanced and group-strategyproof mechanism for the above problem. We also show that our mechanism computes client sets whose social cost is at most O(log2 k) times the minimum social cost of any player set. This matches a lower-bound that was recently given by Roughgarden and Sundararajan (STOC '06)."

We present an O(log n + log m) approximation for robust k-median: The algorithm is combinatorial and very simple, and is based on reweighting/Lagrangean-relaxation ideas. In fact, we give a general framework for (minimization) facility location problems where there is a bound on the number of open facilities. For robust and stochastic versions of such location problems, we show that if the problem satisfies a certain \"projection\" property, essentially the same algorithm gives a logarithmic approximation ratio in both versions. We use our framework to give the first approximation algorithms for robust/stochastic versions of k-tree, capacitated k-median, and fault-tolerant k-median."

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of embedding a metric into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The classical theorems of Bourgain and of Johnson and Lindenstrauss imply that any metric on n points embeds into an O(log n)-dimensional Euclidean space with O(log n) distortion. Moreover, a simple \"volume\" argument shows that this bound is nearly tight: the uniform metric on n points requires &Omega;(log n/log log n) dimensions to embed with logarithmic distortion. It is natural to ask whether such a volume restriction is the only hurdle to low-dimensional low-distortion embeddings. Do doubling metrics, which do not have large uniform submetrics, embed in low dimensional Euclidean spaces with small distortion? In this paper, we answer the question positively and show that any doubling metric embeds into O(log log n) dimensions with o(log n) distortion. In fact, we give a suite of embeddings with a smooth trade-off between distortion and dimension: given an n-point metric (V,d) with doubling dimension dimD, and any target dimension T in the range &Omega;(dimD log log n) &le; T &le; O(log n), we embed the metric into Euclidean space \xE2\x84\x9DT with O(log n&radic;dimD/T) distortion."

    :abstractText: Approximation algorithms for clustering points in metric spaces is a flourishing area of research, with much research effort spent on getting a better understanding of the approximation guarantees possible for many objective functions such as k-median, k-means, and min-sum clustering. This quest for better approximation algorithms is further fueled by the implicit hope that these better approximations also yield more accurate clusterings. E.g., for many problems such as clustering proteins by function, or clustering images by subject, there is some unknown correct "target" clustering and the implicit hope is that approximately optimizing these objective functions will in fact produce a clustering that is close pointwise to the truth. In this paper, we show that if we make this implicit assumption explicit---that is, if we assume that any c-approximation to the given clustering objective &phi; is &epsilon;-close to the target---then we can produce clusterings that are O(&epsilon;)-close to the target, even for values c for which obtaining a c-approximation is NP-hard. In particular, for k-median and k-means objectives, we show that we can achieve this guarantee for any constant c > 1, and for the min-sum objective we can do this for any constant c > 2. Our results also highlight a surprising conceptual difference between assuming that the optimal solution to, say, the k-median objective is &epsilon;-close to the target, and assuming that any approximately optimal solution is &epsilon;-close to the target, even for approximation factor say c = 1.01. In the former case, the problem of finding a solution that is O(&epsilon;)-close to the target remains computationally hard, and yet for the latter we have an efficient algorithm.

    :abstractText: "The classical secretary problem studies the problem of selecting online an element (a \"secretary\") with maximum value in a randomly ordered sequence. The difficulty lies in the fact that an element must be either selected or discarded upon its arrival, and this decision is irrevocable. Constant-competitive algorithms are known for the classical secretary problems (see, e.g., the survey of Freeman [7]) and several variants. We study the following two extensions of the secretary problem: &bull; In the discounted secretary problem, there is a time-dependent \"discount\" factor d(t), and the benefit derived from selecting an element/secretary e at time t is d(t) &middot; v(e). For this problem with arbitrary (not necessarily decreasing) functions d(t), we show a constant-competitive algorithm when the expected optimum is known in advance. With no prior knowledge, we exhibit a lower bound of &Omega;(log n/log log n), and give a nearly-matching O(log n)-competitive algorithm. &bull; In the weighted secretary problem, up to K secretaries can be selected; when a secretary is selected (s)he must be irrevocably assigned to one of K positions, with position k having weight w(k), and assigning object/secretary e to position k has benefit w(k) &middot; v(e). The goal is to select secretaries and assign them to positions to maximize &Sigma;e, k w(k) &middot; v(e) &middot; xek where xek is an indicator variable that secretary e is assigned position k. We give constant-competitive algorithms for this problem. Most of these results can also be extended to the matroid secretary case (Babaioff et al. [2]) for a large family of matroids with a constant-factor loss, and an O(log rank) loss for general matroids. These results are based on a reduction from various matroids to partition matroids which present a unified approach to many of the upper bounds of Babaioff et al. These problems have connections to online mechanism design (see, e.g., Hajiaghayi et al. [9]). All our algorithms are monotone, and hence lead to truthful mechanisms for the corresponding online auction problems."

    :abstractText: "MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching) is a new technology proposed by the IETF [4,10] for network routing, and is being increasingly deployed by the largest Internet service providers. The MPLS technology differs from conventional network protocols in a crucial way: instead of reading the entire packet header at all switching points, the analysis of the packet header is done just once, when the packet header is assigned a stack of labels, and thenceforth, each switching point or router just gets to look at the label at the top of the stack (and the ingress edge), and based only on this information, it has to make a decision about the next-hop node [17,16]. In another departure from conventional routing and in particular from IP source routing, where the entire packet route is explicitly put in the header and popped off along the route, the router can not only pop the top label, it can push other labels on top of the stack.The two parameters of interest in designing MPLS routing protocols are the number of labels used, and the depth of the stack used for routing. Clearly, both cannot be simultaneously minimized, and there is often an interesting trade-off between label size and stack depth: it is obvious that if k labels are used, one must have a stack depth of logk n.In fact, it was not known whether this bound could be achieved even for trees; the best stack depth previously achieved with a constant number of labels was O(log2 n). In this paper, we show that one can indeed get asymptotically optimal upper bounds and route on trees using k labels and a maximum stack depth of O(logk n), and that this trade-off can be achieved using a simpler and more intuitive protocol than the one given in [9]. These tree-routing ideas are then shown to give better routing protocols for planar graphs as well. In particular, we show how to route along near-shortest paths (of length at most (1 + \xCE\xB5) times the shortest-path) with O(log2 n/\xCE\xB5) labels and logarithmic stack depth. We also apply them to graphs with smaller separators, including most large ISP networks."

    :abstractText: Consider a setting in which a group of nodes, situated in a large underlying network, wishes to reserve bandwidth on which to support communication. Virtual private networks (VPNs) are services that support such a construct; rather than building a new physical network on the group of nodes that must be connected, bandwidth in the underlying network is reserved for communication within the group, forming a virtual &ldquo;sub-network.&rdquo;Provisioning a virtual private network over a set off terminals gives rise to the following general network design problem. We have bounds on the cumulative amount of traffic each terminal can send and receive; we must choose a path for each pair of terminals, and a bandwidth allocation for each edge of the network, so that any traffic matrix consistent with the given upper bounds can be feasibly routed. Thus, we are seeking to design a network that can support a continuum of possible traffic scenarios.We provide optimal and approximate algorithms for several variants of this problem, depending on whether the traffic matrix is required to be symmetric, and on whether the designed network is required to be a tree (a natural constraint in a number of basic applications). We also establish a relation between this collection of network design problems and a variant of the facility location problem introduced by Karger and Minkoff; we extend their results by providing a stronger approximation algorithm for this latter problem.

    :abstractText: "Several combinatorial optimization problems choose elements to minimize the total cost of constructing a feasible solution that satisfies requirements of clients. In the Steiner Tree problem, for example, edges must be chosen to connect terminals (clients); in Vertex Cover, vertices must be chosen to cover edges (clients); in Facility Location, facilities must be chosen and demand vertices (clients) connected to these chosen facilities. We consider a stochastic version of such a problem where the solution is constructed in two stages: Before the actual requirements materialize, we can choose elements in a first stage. The actual requirements are then revealed, drawn from a pre-specified probability distribution \xCF\x80 thereupon, some more elements may be chosen to obtain a feasible solution for the actual requirements. However, in this second (recourse) stage, choosing an element is costlier by a factor of \xCF\x83> 1. The goal is to minimize the first stage cost plus the expected second stage cost.We give a general yet simple technique to adapt approximation algorithms for several deterministic problems to their stochastic versions via the following method. First stage: Draw \xCF\x83 independent sets of clients from the distribution \xCF\x80 and apply the approximation algorithm to construct a feasible solution for the union of these sets. Second stage: Since the actual requirements have now been revealed, augment the first-stage solution to be feasible for these requirements. We use this framework to derive constant factor approximations for stochastic versions of Vertex Cover, Steiner Tree and Uncapacitated Facility Location for arbitrary distributions \xCF\x80 in one fell swoop. For special (product) distributions, we obtain additional and improved results. Our techniques adapt and use the notion of strict cost-shares introduced in [5]."

    :abstractText: "We present approximation algorithms for the unsplittable flow problem (UFP) in undirected graphs. As is standard in this line of research, we assume that the maximum demand is at most the minimum capacity. We focus on the non-uniform capacity case in which the edge capacities can vary arbitrarily over the graph. Our results are: We obtain an $O({\\Delta}\\alpha^{-1} \\log^2 n)$ approximation ratio for UFP, where n is the number of vertices, ${\\Delta}$ is the maximum degree, and $\\alpha$ is the expansion of the graph. Furthermore, if we specialize to the case where all edges have the same capacity, our algorithm gives an $O({\\Delta} \\alpha^{-1} \\log n)$ approximation. For certain strong constant-degree expanders considered by Frieze [17] we obtain an $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ approximation for the uniform capacity case. For UFP on the line and the ring, we give the first constant-factor approximation algorithms. All of the above results improve if the maximum demand is bounded away from the minimum capacity. The above results either improve upon or are incomparable with previously known results for these problems. The main technique used for these results is randomized rounding followed by greedy alteration, and is inspired by the use of this idea in recent work."

    :abstractText: "The k-forest problem is a common generalization of both the k-MST and the dense-k-subgraph problems. Formally, given a metric space on n vertices V, with m demand pairs \xE2\x8A\x86 V \xC3\x97 V and a \"target\" k \xE2\x89\xA4 m, the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connects at least k demand pairs. In this paper, we give an O(min{\xE2\x88\x9An,\xE2\x88\x9Ak})- approximation algorithm for k-forest, improving on the previous best ratio of O(min{n2/3,\xE2\x88\x9Am} log n) by Segev and Segev [20]. We then apply our algorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the following: given an n point metric space with m objects each with its own source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most k objects at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each object from its source to destination. We prove that an a-approximation algorithm for the k-forest problem implies an O(\xCE\xB1\xC4\x8Blog2 n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our results for k-forest, we get an O(min{\xE2\x88\x9An,\xE2\x88\x9Ak}\xC4\x8Blog2 n)-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for Dial-a-Ride was an O(\xE2\x88\x9Ak log n)-approximation by Charikar and Raghavachari [5]; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation guarantee-- in fact, when the vehicle capacity k is large, we give a slight improvement on their results. The reduction from Dial-a-Ride to the k-forest problem is fairly robust, and allows us to obtain approximation algorithms (with the same guarantee) for the following generalizations: (i) Non-uniform Dial-a-Ride, where the cost of traversing each edge is an arbitrary nondecreasing function of the number of objects in the vehicle; and (ii) Weighted Diala-Ride, where demands are allowed to have different weights. The reduction is essential, as it is unclear how to extend the techniques of Charikar and Raghavachari to these Dial-a-Ride generalizations."

    :abstractText: In the MULTIWAY CUT problem, we are given an undirected edge-weighted graph G=(V,E) with c"e denoting the cost (weight) of edge e. We are also given a subset S of V, of size k, called the terminals. The objective is to find a minimum cost set of edges whose removal ensures that the terminals are disconnected. In this paper, we study a bidirected linear programming relaxation of MULTIWAY CUT. We resolve an open problem posed by Vazirani [Approximation Algorithms, first ed., Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2001], and show that the integrality gap of this relaxation is not better than that for a geometric linear programming relaxation given by Ca@?linescu et al. [J. Comput. System Sci. 60(3) (2000) 564-574], and may be strictly worse on some instances.

    :abstractText: Given a metric M = (V, d), a graph G = (V, E) is a t-spanner for M if every pair of nodes in V has a "short" path (i.e., of length at most t times their actual distance) between them in the spanner. Furthermore, this spanner has a hop diameter bounded by D if every such short path also uses at most D edges. We consider the problem of constructing sparse (1 + &epsilon;)-spanners with small hop diameter for metrics of low doubling dimension.In this paper, we show that given any metric with constant doubling dimension k, and any 0 < &epsilon; < 1, one can find a (1 + &epsilon;)-spanner for the metric with nearly linear number of edges (i.e., only O(n log* n + n&epsilon;-O(k)) edges) and a constant hop diameter, and also a (1 + &epsilon;)-spanner with linear number of edges (i.e., only n&epsilon;-O(k) edges) which achieves a hop diameter that grows like the functional inverse of the Ackermann's function. Moreover, we prove that such tradeoffs between the number of edges and the hop diameter are asymptotically optimal.

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of embedding finite metrics with slack: We seek to produce embeddings with small dimension and distortion while allowing a (small) constant fraction of all distances to be arbitrarily distorted. This definition is motivated by recent research in the networking community, which achieved striking empirical success at embedding Internet latencies with low distortion into low-dimensional Euclidean space, provided that some small slack is allowed. Answering an open question of Kleinberg, Slivkins, and Wexler [in Proceedings of the 45th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2004], we show that provable guarantees of this type can in fact be achieved in general: Any finite metric space can be embedded, with constant slack and constant distortion, into constant-dimensional Euclidean space. We then show that there exist stronger embeddings into $\\ell_1$ which exhibit gracefully degrading distortion: There is a single embedding into $\\ell_1$ that achieves distortion at most $O(\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ on all but at most-1.5pt an $\\epsilon$ fraction of distances simultaneously for all $\\epsilon>0$. We extend this with distortion1pt $O(\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^{1/p}$ to maps into general $\\ell_p$, $p\\geq1$, for several classes of metrics, including those with bounded doubling dimension and those arising from the shortest-path metric of a graph with an excluded minor. Finally, we show that many of our constructions are tight and give a general technique to obtain lower bounds for $\\epsilon$-slack embeddings from lower bounds for low-distortion embeddings."

    :abstractText: In this article, we study metrics of negative type, which are metrics (V, d) such that &sqrt;d is an Euclidean metric; these metrics are thus also known as &ell;2-squared metrics. We show how to embed n-point negative-type metrics into Euclidean space &ell;2 with distortion D &equals; O(log3/4n). This embedding result, in turn, implies an O(log3/4k)-approximation algorithm for the Sparsest Cut problem with nonuniform demands. Another corollary we obtain is that n-point subsets of &ell;1 embed into &ell;2 with distortion O(log3/4 n).

    :abstractText: "Consider the following classical network design problem: a set of terminals T &equals; &lcub;ti&rcub; wishes to send traffic to a root r in an n-node graph G &equals; (V, E). Each terminal ti sends di units of traffic and enough bandwidth has to be allocated on the edges to permit this. However, bandwidth on an edge e can only be allocated in integral multiples of some base capacity ue and hence provisioning k &times; ue bandwidth on edge e incurs a cost of &lceil;k&rceil; times the cost of that edge. The objective is a minimum-cost feasible solution. This is one of many network design problems widely studied where the bandwidth allocation is governed by side constraints: edges can only allow a subset of cables to be purchased on them or certain quality-of-service requirements may have to be met. In this work, we show that this problem and, in fact, several basic problems in this general network design framework cannot be approximated better than &Omega;(log log n) unless NP &sube; DTIME (nO(log log log n)), where &verbar;V&verbar; &equals; n. In particular, we show that this inapproximability threshold holds for (i) the Priority-Steiner Tree problem, (ii) the (single-sink) Cost-Distance problem, and (iii) the single-sink version of an even more fundamental problem, Fixed Charge Network Flow. Our results provide a further breakthrough in the understanding of the level of complexity of network design problems. These are the first nonconstant hardness results known for all these problems."

    :abstractText: "Static expression experiments analyze samples from many individuals. These samples are often snapshots of the progression of a certain disease such as cancer. This raises an intriguing question: Can we determine a temporal order for these samples? Such an ordering can lead to better understanding of the dynamics of the disease and to the identification of genes associated with its progression. In this paper we formally prove, for the first time, that under a model for the dynamics of the expression levels of a single gene, it is indeed possible to recover the correct ordering of the static expression datasets by solving an instance of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). In addition, we devise an algorithm that combines a TSP heuristic and probabilistic modeling for inferring the underlying temporal order of the microarray experiments. This algorithm constructs probabilistic continuous curves to represent expression profiles leading to accurate temporal reconstruction for human data. Applying our method to cancer expression data we show that the ordering derived agrees well with survival duration. A classifier that utilizes this ordering improves upon other classifiers suggested for this task. The set of genes displaying consistent behavior for the determined ordering are enriched for genes associated with cancer progression."

Which edges should we buy today so that we can extend it to a solution for the instance arriving tomorrow, to minimize the expected total cost? While very general results have been developed for many problems in stochastic discrete optimization over the past years, the approximation status of the stochastic Steiner Forest problem has remained open, with previous works yielding constant-factor approximations only for special cases. We resolve the status of this problem by giving a constant-factor primal-dual based approximation algorithm."

    :abstractText: "Consider the edge-connectivity survivable network design problem: given a graph G = (V,E) with edge-costs, and edge-connectivity requirements rij for every pair of vertices i,j, find an (approximately) minimum-cost network that provides the required connectivity. While this problem is known to admit good approximation algorithms in the offline case, no algorithms were known for this problem in the online setting. In this paper, we give a randomized O(rmax log3 n) competitive online algorithm for this edge-connectivity network design problem, where rmax = maxij rij. Our algorithms use the standard embeddings of graphs into random subtrees (i.e., into singly connected subgraphs) as an intermediate step to get algorithms for higher connectivity. Our results for the online problem give us approximation algorithms that admit strict cost-shares with the same strictness value. This, in turn, implies approximation algorithms for (a) the rent-or-buy version and (b) the (two-stage) stochastic version of the edge-connected network design problem with independent arrivals. For these two problems, if we are in the case when the underlying graph is complete and the edge-costs are metric (i.e., satisfy the triangle inequality), we improve our results to give O(1)-strict cost shares, which gives constant-factor rent-or-buy and stochastic algorithms for these instances."

    :abstractText: We study the Steiner tree problem and the single-cable single-sink network design problem under a two-stage stochastic model with recourse and finitely many scenarios. In these models, some edges are purchased in a first stage when only probabilistic information about the second stage is available. In the second stage, one of a finite number of specified scenarios is realized, which results in the set of terminals becoming known and the opportunity to purchase additional edges (under an inflated cost function) to augment the first-stage solution. We provide constant factor approximation algorithms for these problems by rounding the linear relaxation of IP formulations of the problems. Our algorithms involve solving the linear relaxation first, followed by a primal-dual routine that is guided by the LP solution. We also show that because our bounds are local (the cost of each component is bounded by its cost in the LP solution), we are able to obtain bounds that guard against a form of downside risk.

    :abstractText: "Multiprotocol label switching or MPLS technology is being increasingly deployed by several of the largest Internet service providers to solve problems such as traffic engineering and to offer IP services like virtual private networks (VPNs). In MPLS, the analysis of the packet (network layer) header is performed just once, and each packet is assigned a stack of labels, which is examined by subsequent routers when making forwarding decisions. Despite the fact that MPLS is becoming widespread on the Internet, we know essentially very little about the performance one can achieve with it, and about the intrinsic trade-offs in its use of resources. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of the label size versus stack depth trade-off for MPLS routing protocols on lines and trees. We show that in addition to LSP tunneling, label stacks can also be used to dramatically reduce the number of labels required for setting up MPLS LSPs in a network. Based on this observation, we develop routing algorithms and prove lower bounds for two basic problems: (1) fixed label routing: given a fixed number of labels, we want to minimize the stack depth, and (2) fixed stack routing: given a bound on the stack depth, we want to minimize the number of labels used. Our simulation results validate our approach, demonstrating that our novel protocols enable MPLS routing on large trees with few labels and small stack sizes. Thus, our MPLS routing algorithms are applicable to a number of practical scenarios involving the provisioning of VPNs and multicast trees."

    :abstractText: "This paper studies an extension of the k-median problem under uncertain demand. We are given an n-vertex metric space (V, d) and m client sets <inline-formula><tex-math>$\\{S_i \\subseteq V\\}_{i = 1}^m$</tex-math></inline-formula>. The goal is to open a set of k facilities F such that the worst-case connection cost over all the client sets is minimized, i.e., <disp-formula><tex-math>\\min_{F \\subseteq V, |F| = k}\\max_{i \\in [m]}\\left \\{\\sum_{j \\in S_i} d(j, F)\\right\\},</tex-math></disp-formula> where for any <inline-formula><tex-math>$F \\subseteq V, d(j, F) = \\min_{f \\in F} d(j, f)$</tex-math></inline-formula>. This is a \xE2\x80\x9Cmin-max\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Crobust\xE2\x80\x9D version of the k-median problem. Note that in contrast to the recent papers on robust and stochastic problems, we have only one stage of decision-making where we select a set of k facilities to open. Once a set of open facilities is fixed, each client in the uncertain client-set connects to the closest open facility. We present a simple, combinatorial O(log n + log m)-approximation algorithm for the robust k-median problem that is based on reweighting/Lagrangean-relaxation ideas. In fact, we give a general framework for (minimization) k-facility location problems where there is a bound on the number of open facilities. We show that if the location problem satisfies a certain \xE2\x80\x9Cprojection\xE2\x80\x9D property, then both the robust and stochastic versions of the location problem admit approximation algorithms with logarithmic ratios. We use our framework to give the first approximation algorithms for robust and stochastic versions of several location problems such as k-tree, capacitated k-median, and fault-tolerant k-median."

    :abstractText: This paper presents results for the queue-read, queue-write asynchronous parallel random access machine (QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM) model, which is the asynchronous variant of the QRQW PRAM model. The QRQW PRAM family of models, which was introduced earlier by the authors, permit concurrent reading and writing to shared memory locations, but each memory location is viewed as having a queue which can service at most one request at a time. In the basic QRQW PRAM model each processor executes a series of reads to shared memory locations, a series of local computation steps, and a series of writes to shared memory locations, and then synchronizes with all other processors; thus this can be viewed as a bulk-synchronous model. In contrast, in the QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM model discussed in this paper, there is no synchronization between processors, and each processor proceeds at its own pace. Thus, the QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM serves as a better model for truly asynchronous parallel machines than the original QRQW PRAM. In this paper we elaborate on the QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM model, and we demonstrate the power of full asynchrony over bulk-asynchrony by presenting a work and time optimal deterministic algorithm on the QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM for the leader election problem and a simple randomized work and time optimal algorithm on the QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM for sorting. In contrast, no tight bounds are known on the QRQW PRAM for either deterministic or randomized parallel algorithms for leader election and the only work and time optimal algorithms for sorting known on the QRQW PRAM are those inherited from the EREW PRAM, which are considerably more complicated. Our sorting algorithm is an asynchronous version of an earlier sorting algorithm we developed for the QRQW PRAM, for which we use an interesting analysis to bound the running time to be O(lg n). We also present a randomized algorithm to simulate one step of a CRCW PRAM on a QRQW ASYNCHRONOUS PRAM in sublogarithmic time if the maximum concurrency in the step is relatively small.

    :abstractText: Wide-area sensing services enable users to query data collected from multitudes of widely distributed sensors. In this paper, we consider the novel distributed database workload characteristics of these services, and present IDP, an online, adaptive data placement and replication system tailored to this workload. Given a hierarchical database, IDP automatically partitions it among a set of networked hosts, and replicates portions of it. IDP makes decisions based on measurements of access locality within the database, read and write load for individual objects within the database, proximity between queriers and potential replicas, and total load on hosts participating in the database. Our evaluation of IDP under real and synthetic workloads, including flash crowds of queriers, demonstrates that in comparison with previously-studied replica placement techniques, IDP reduces average response times for user queries by up to a factor of 3 and reduces network traffic for queries, updates, and data movements by up to an order of magnitude.

    :abstractText: Existing DHT-based file systems use consistent hashing to assign file blocks to random machines. As a result, a user task accessing an entire file or multiple files needs to retrieve blocks from many different machines. This paper demonstrates that significant availability and performance gains can be achieved if, instead, users are able to retrieve all the data needed for a given task from only a few DHT nodes. We explore the design and implications of such a "defragmented" DHT-based distributed file system, called D2, that also maintains important DHT properties like storage load balance. We show using real-world file system traces that a simple key encoding scheme is sufficient to maintain good defragmentation for most user tasks. Using both simulation and an actual 1,000 node deployment, we show that D2 increases availability by over an order of magnitude and improves user-perceived latency by 30" 100% compared to a traditional design.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a semantic space profiler for parallel functional programs. Building on previous work in sequential profiling, our tools help programmers to relate runtime resource use back to program source code. Unlike many profiling tools, our profiler is based on a cost semantics. This provides a means to reason about performance without requiring a detailed understanding of the compiler or runtime system. It also provides a specification for language implementers. This is critical in that it enables us to separate cleanly the performance of the application from that of the language implementation. Some aspects of the implementation can have significant effects on performance. Our cost semantics enables programmers to understand the impact of different scheduling policies while hiding many of the details of their implementations. We show applications where the choice of scheduling policy has asymptotic effects on space use. We explain these use patterns through a demonstration of our tools. We also validate our methodology by observing similar performance in our implementation of a parallel extension of Standard ML.

    :abstractText: Geographic routing is a useful and scalable point-to-point communication primitive for wireless sensor networks. However, previous work on geographic routing makes the unrealistic assumption that all the nodes in the network are awake during routing. This overlooks the common deployment scenario where sensor nodes are duty-cycled to save energy. In this paper we investigate several important aspects of geographic routing over duty-cycled nodes. First, we extend existing geographic routing algorithms to handle the highly dynamic networks resulting from duty-cycling. Second, we provide the first formal analysis of the performance of geographic routing on duty-cycled nodes. Third, we use this analysis to develop an efficient decentralized sleep scheduling algorithm for reducing the number of awake nodes while maintaining both network coverage and a (tunable) target routing latency. Finally, we evaluate via simulation the performance of our approach versus running existing geographic routing algorithms on sensors duty-cycled according to previous sleep scheduling algorithms. Our results show, perhaps surprisingly, that a network of duty-cycled nodes can have slightly better routing performance than a static network that uses comparable energy. Our results further show that, compared to previous algorithms, our sleep scheduling algorithm significantly improves routing latency and network lifetime.

    :abstractText: Scalable shared-memory multiprocessors distribute memory among the processors and use scalable interconnection networks to provide high bandwidth and low latency communication. In addition, memory accesses are cached, buffered, and pipelined to bridge the gap between the slow shared memory and the fast processors. Unless carefully controlled, such architectural optimizations can cause memory accesses to be executed in an order different from what the programmer expects. The set of allowable memory access orderings forms the memory consistency model or event ordering model for an architecture. This paper introduces a new model of memory consistency, called release consistency, that allows for more buffering and pipelining than previously proposed models. A framework for classifying shared accesses and reasoning about event ordering is developed. The release consistency model is shown to be equivalent to the sequential consistency model for parallel programs with sufficient synchronization. Possible performance gains from the less strict constraints of the release consistency model are explored. Finally, practical implementation issues are discussed, concentrating on issues relevant to scalable architectures.

    :abstractText: High availability is widely accepted as an explicit requirement for distributed storage systems. Tolerating correlated failures is a key issue in achieving high availability in today's wide-area environments. This paper systematically revisits previously proposed techniques for addressing correlated failures. Using several real-world failure traces, we qualitatively answer four important questions regarding how to design systems to tolerate such failures. Based on our results, we identify a set of design principles that system builders can use to tolerate correlated failures. We show how these lessons can be effectively used by incorporating them into IrisStore, a distributed read-write storage layer that provides high availability. Our results using IrisStore on the PlanetLab over an 8-month period demonstrate its ability to withstand large correlated failures and meet preconfigured availability targets.

    :abstractText: Data replication is a key technique for ensuring data availability. Traditionally, researchers have focused on the availability of individual objects, even though user-level tasks (called operations) typically request multiple objects. Our recent experimental study has shown that the assignment of object replicas to machines results in subtle yet dramatic effects on the availability of these operations, even though the availability of individual objects remains the same. This paper is the first to approach the assignment problem from a theoretical perspective, and obtains a series of results regarding assignments that provide the best and the worst availability for user-level operations. We use a range of techniques to obtain our results, from standard combinatorial techniques and hill climbing methods to Janson's inequality (a strong probabilistic tool). Some of the results demonstrate that even quite simple versions of the assignment problem can have surprising answers.

    :abstractText: Previous approaches for computing duplicate-sensitive aggregates in wireless sensor networks have used a tree topology, in order to conserve energy and to avoid double-counting sensor readings. However, a tree topology is not robust against node and communication failures, which are common in sensor networks. In this article, we present synopsis diffusion, a general framework for achieving significantly more accurate and reliable answers by combining energy-efficient multipath routing schemes with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis diffusion avoids double-counting through the use of order- and duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses that compactly summarize intermediate results during in-network aggregation. We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis diffusion create implicit acknowledgments of packet delivery. Such acknowledgments enable energy-efficient adaptation of message routes to dynamic message loss conditions, even in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate using extensive simulations the significant robustness, accuracy, and energy-efficiency improvements of synopsis diffusion over previous approaches.

    :abstractText: Peer-to-peer and other decentralized, distributed systems are known to be particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks. In a sybil attack, a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the system. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to "out vote" the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the "social network" among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately small "cut" in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number of identities a malicious user can create. We show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally.

    :abstractText: For a wide variety of computational tasks, disk I/O continues to be a serious obstacle to high performance. The focus of the present paper is on systems that use multiple disks per SCSI bus. We measured the performance of concurrent random I/Os, and observed bus-related phenomena that impair performance. We describe these phenomena, and present a new I/O performance model that accurately predicts the average bandwidth achieved by a heavy workload of random reads from disks on a SCSI bus. This model, although relatively simple, predicts performance on several platforms to within 12% for I/O sizes in the range 16-128 KB. We describe a technique to improve the I/O bandwidth by 10-20% for random-access workloads that have large I/Os and high concurrency. This technique increases the percentage of disk head positioning time that is overlapped with data transfers, and increases the percentage of transfers that occur at bus bandwidth, rather than at disk-head bandwidth.

    :abstractText: In large data warehousing environments, it is often advantageous to provide fast, approximate answers to complex decision support queries using precomputed summary statistics, such as samples. Decision support queries routinely segment the data into groups and then aggregate the information in each group (group-by queries). Depending on the data, there can be a wide disparity between the number of data items in each group. As a result, approximate answers based on uniform random samples of the data can result in poor accuracy for groups with very few data items, since such groups will be represented in the sample by very few (often zero) tuples. In this paper, we propose a general class of techniques for obtaining fast, highly-accurate answers for group-by queries. These techniques rely on precomputed non-uniform (biased) samples of the data. In particular, we propose congressional samples, a hybrid union of uniform and biased samples. Given a fixed amount of space, congressional samples seek to maximize the accuracy for all possible group-by queries on a set of columns. We present a one pass algorithm for constructing a congressional sample and use this technique to also incrementally maintain the sample up-to-date without accessing the base relation. We also evaluate query rewriting strategies for providing approximate answers from congressional samples. Finally, we conduct an extensive set of experiments on the TPC-D database, which demonstrates the efficacy of the techniques proposed.

It has been designed to run on top of any commercial relational DBMS. Aqua precomputes synopses (special statistical summaries) of the original data and stores them in the DBMS. It provides approximate answers along with quality guarantees by rewriting the queries to run on these synopses. Finally, Aqua keeps the synopses up-to-date as the database changes, using fast incremental maintenance techniques.

    :abstractText: In large data warehousing environments, it is often advantageous to provide fast, approximate answers to complex aggregate queries based on statistical summaries of the full data. In this paper, we demonstrate the difficulty of providing good approximate answers for join-queries using only statistics (in particular, samples) from the base relations. We propose join synopses as an effective solution for this problem and show how precomputing just one join synopsis for each relation suffices to significantly improve the quality of approximate answers for arbitrary queries with foreign key joins. We present optimal strategies for allocating the available space among the various join synopses when the query work load is known and identify heuristics for the common case when the work load is not known. We also present efficient algorithms for incrementally maintaining join synopses in the presence of updates to the base relations. Our extensive set of experiments on the TPC-D benchmark database show the effectiveness of join synopses and various other techniques proposed in this paper.

    :abstractText: Webcams, microphones, pressure gauges and other sensors provide exciting new opportunities for querying and monitoring the physical world. In this paper we focus on querying wide area sensor databases, containing (XML) data derived from sensors spread over tens to thousands of miles. We present the first scalable system for executing XPATH queries on such databases. The system maintains the logical view of the data as a single XML document, while physically the data is fragmented across any number of host nodes. For scalability, sensor data is stored close to the sensors, but can be cached elsewhere as dictated by the queries. Our design enables self starting distributed queries that jump directly to the lowest common ancestor of the query result, dramatically reducing query response times. We present a novel query-evaluate gather technique (using XSLT) for detecting (1) which data in a local database fragment is part of the query result, and (2) how to gather the missing parts. We define partitioning and cache invariants that ensure that even partial matches on cached data are exploited and that correct answers are returned, despite our dynamic query-driven caching. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques dramatically increase query throughputs and decrease query response times in wide area sensor databases.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces bifocal sampling, a new technique for estimating the size of an equi-join of two relations. Bifocal sampling classifies tuples in each relation into two groups, sparse and dense, based on the number of tuples with the same join value. Distinct estimation procedures are employed that focus on various combinations for joining tuples (e.g., for estimating the number of joining tuples that are dense in both relations). This combination of estimation procedures overcomes some well-known problems in previous schemes, enabling good estimates with no a priori knowledge about the data distribution. The estimate obtained by the bifocal sampling algorithm is proven to lie with high probability within a small constant factor of the actual join size, regardless of the skew, as long as the join size is &Omega;(n lg n), for relations consisting of n tuples. The algorithm requires a sample of size at most O(&radic;n lg n). By contrast, previous algorithms using a sample of similar size may require the join size to be &Omega;(n&radic;n) to guarantee an accurate estimate. Experimental results support the theoretical claims and show that bifocal sampling is practical and effective.

    :abstractText: Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of the wavelet decomposition in reducing large amounts of data to compact sets of wavelet coefficients (termed "wavelet synopses") that can be used to provide fast and reasonably accurate approximate answers to queries. A major criticism of such techniques is that unlike, for example, random sampling, conventional wavelet synopses do not provide informative error guarantees on the accuracy of individual approximate answers. In fact, as this paper demonstrates, errors can vary widely (without bound) and unpredictably, even for identical queries on nearly-identical values in distinct parts of the data. This lack of error guarantees severely limits the practicality of traditional wavelets as an approximate query-processing tool, because users have no idea of the quality of any particular approximate answer. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic Wavelet Synopses, the first wavelet-based data reduction technique with guarantees on the accuracy of individual approximate answers. Whereas earlier approaches rely on deterministic thresholding for selecting a set of "good" wavelet coefficients, our technique is based on a novel, probabilistic thresholding scheme that assigns each coefficient a probability of being retained based on its importance to the reconstruction of individual data values, and then flips coins to select the synopsis. We show how our scheme avoids the above pitfalls of deterministic thresholding, providing highly-accurate answers for individual data values in a data vector. We propose several novel optimization algorithms for tuning our probabilistic thresholding scheme to minimize desired error metrics. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data sets evaluate these algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our probabilistic wavelet synopses in providing fast, highly-accurate answers with error guarantees.

    :abstractText: In large data recording and warehousing environments, it is often advantageous to provide fast, approximate answers to queries, whenever possible. Before DBMSs providing highly-accurate approximate answers can become a reality, many new techniques for summarizing data and for estimating answers from summarized data must be developed. This paper introduces two new sampling-based summary statistics, concise samples and counting samples, and presents new techniques for their fast incremental maintenance regardless of the data distribution. We quantify their advantages over standard sample views in terms of the number of additional sample points for the same view size, and hence in providing more accurate query answers. Finally, we consider their application to providing fast approximate answers to hot list queries. Our algorithms maintain their accuracy in the presence of ongoing insertions to the data warehouse.

    :abstractText: Existing energy-efficient approaches to in-network aggregation in sensor networks can be classified into two categories, tree-based and multi-path-based, with each having unique strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we introduce Tributary-Delta, a novel approach that combines the advantages of the tree and multi-path approaches by running them simultaneously in different regions of the network. We present schemes for adjusting the regions in response to changes in network conditions, and show how many useful aggregates can be readily computed within this new framework. We then show how a difficult aggregate for this context---finding frequent items---can be efficiently computed within the framework. To this end, we devise the first algorithm for frequent items (and for quantiles) that provably minimizes the worst case total communication for non-regular trees. In addition, we give a multi-path algorithm for frequent items that is considerably more accurate than previous approaches. These algorithms form the basis for our efficient Tributary-Delta frequent items algorithm. Through extensive simulation with real-world and synthetic data, we show the significant advantages of our techniques. For example, in computing Count under realistic loss rates, our techniques reduce answer error by up to a factor of 3 compared to any previous technique.

    :abstractText: As part of an effort to develop an optimizing compiler for a pipelined architecture, a code reorganization algorithm has been developed that significantly reduces the number of runtime pipeline interlocks. In a pass after code generation, the algorithm uses a dag representation to heuristically schedule the instructions in each basic block.Previous algorithms for reducing pipeline interlocks have had worst-case runtimes of at least O (n4). By using a dag representation which prevents scheduling deadlocks and a selection method that requires no lookahead, the resulting algorithm reorganizes instructions almost as effectively in practice, while having an O (n2) worst-case runtime.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a multicore-cache model that reflects the reality that multicore processors have both per-processor private (L1) caches and a large shared (L2) cache on chip. We consider a broad class of parallel divide-and-conquer algorithms and present a new on-line scheduler, CONTROLLED-PDF, that is competitive with the standard sequential scheduler in the following sense. Given any dynamically unfolding computation DAG from this class of algorithms, the cache complexity on the multicore-cache model under our new scheduler is within a constant factor of the sequential cache complexity for both L1 and L2, while the time complexity is within a constant factor of the sequential time complexity divided by the number of processors p. These are the first such asymptotically-optimal results for any multicore model. Finally, we show that a separator-based algorithm for sparse-matrix-dense-vector-multiply achieves provably good cache performance in the multicore-cache model, as well as in the well-studied sequential cache-oblivious model.

    :abstractText: "Decentralized distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems are particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks, where a malicious user pretends to have multiple identities (called sybil nodes). Without a trusted central authority, defending against sybil attacks is quite challenging. Among the small number of decentralized approaches, our recent SybilGuard protocol [42] leverages a key insight on social networks to bound the number of sybil nodes accepted. Although its direction is promising, SybilGuard can allow a large number of sybil nodes to be accepted. Furthermore, SybilGuard assumes that social networks are fast mixing, which has never been confirmed in the real world. This paper presents the novel SybilLimit protocol that leverages the same insight as SybilGuard but offers dramatically improved and near-optimal guarantees. The number of sybil nodes accepted is reduced by a factor of Theta(sqrt(n)), or around 200 times in our experiments for a million-node system. We further prove that SybilLimit\xE2\x80\x99s guarantee is atmost a log n factor away from optimal, when considering approaches based on fast-mixing social networks. Finally, based on three large-scale real-world social networks, we provide the first evidence that real-world social networks are indeed fast mixing. This validates the fundamental assumption behind SybilLimit\xE2\x80\x99s and SybilGuard\xE2\x80\x99s approach."

    :abstractText: We present a class of synchronization called room synchronizations and show how this class can be used to implement asynchronous parallel queues and stacks with constant time access (assuming a fetch-and-add operation). The room synchronization problem involves supporting a set of m mutually exclusive &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; where any number of users can execute code simultaneously in any one of the rooms, but no two users can simultaneously execute code in separate rooms. Users asynchronously request permission to enter specified rooms, and neither the arrival time nor the arrival order nor the desired room of such requests are known ahead of time. We describe an algorithm for room synchronizations, and prove it satisfies a number of desirable properties. We have implemented our algorithm on a Sun UltraEnterprise 10000 multiprocessor. We present experimental results comparing an implementation of a parallel stack using room synchronizations to one using locks, demonstrating a significant scalability advantage for room synchronizations.

    :abstractText: "We compare the number of cache misses M1 for running a computation on a single processor with cache size C1 to the total number of misses Mp for the same computation when using p processors or threads and a shared cache of size Cp. We show that for any computation, and with an appropriate (greedy) parallel schedule, if Cp \xE2\x89\xA5 C1 + pd then Mp \xE2\x89\xA4 M1. The depth d of the computation is the length of the critical path of dependences. This gives the perhaps surprising result that for sufficiently parallel computations the shared cache need only be an additive size larger than the single-processor cache, and gives some theoretical justification for designing machines with shared caches.We model a computation as a DAG and the sequential execution as a depth first schedule of the DAG. The parallel schedule we study is a parallel depth-first schedule (PDF schedule) based on the sequential one. The schedule is greedy and therefore work-efficient. Our main results assume the Ideal Cache model, but we also present results for other more realistic cache models."

    :abstractText: Many high-level parallel programming languages allow for fine-grained parallelism. As in the popular work-time framework for parallel algorithm design, programs written in such languages can express the full parallelism in the program without specifying the mapping of program tasks to processors. A common concern in executing such programs is to schedule tasks to processors dynamically so as to minimize not only the execution time, but also the amount of space (memory) needed. Without careful scheduling, the parallel execution on p processors can use a factor of p or larger more space than a sequential implementation of the same program.This paper first identifies a class of parallel schedules that are provably efficient in both time and space. For any computation with w units of work and critical path length d, and for any sequential schedule that takes space s1, we provide a parallel schedule that takes fewer than w/p + d steps on p processors and requires less than s1 + p&dot;d space. This matches the lower bound that we show, and significantly improves upon the best previous bound of s1&dot;p spaces for the common case where d<<s1. The paper then describes a scheduler for implementing high-level languages with nested parallelism, that generates schedules in this class. During program execution, as the structure of the computation is revealed, the scheduler keeps track of the active tasks, allocates the tasks to the processors, and performs the necessary task synchronization. The scheduler is itself a parallel algorithm, and incurs at most a constant factor overhead in time and space, even when the scheduling granularity is individual units of work. The algorithm is the first efficient solution to the scheduling problem discussed here, even if space considerations are ignored.

    :abstractText: "For years, the computation rate of processors has been much faster than the access rate of memory banks, and this divergence in speeds has been constantly increasing in recent years. As a result, several shared-memory multiprocessors consist of more memory banks than processors. The object of this paper is to provide a simple model (with only a few parameters) for the design and analysis of irregular parallel algorithms that will give a reasonable characterization of performance on such machines. For this purpose, we extend Valiant's bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model with two parameters: a parameter for memory bank delay, the minimum time for servicing requests at a bank, and a parameter for memory bank expansion, the ratio of the number of banks to the number of processors. We call this model the (d, x)-BSP. We show experimentally that the (d, x)-BSP captures the impact of bank contention and delay on the CRAY C90 and J90 for irregular access patterns, without modeling machine-specific details of these machines. The model has clarified the performance characteristics of several unstructured algorithms on the CRAY C90 and J90, and allowed us to explore tradeoffs and optimizations for these algorithms. In addition to modeling individual algorithms directly, we also consider the use of the (d, x)-BSP as a bridging model for emulating a very high-level abstract model, the Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for emulating the EREW and QRQW PRAMs on the (d, x)-BSP."

    :abstractText: Sequential consistency is the most-widely used correctness condition for multiprocessor memory systems. High-performance shared memory multiprocessors such as the Kendall Square KSR1, the Stanford DASH, and the MIT Alewife employ a variety of techniques to improve memory system performance while providing sequential consistency. Primary among them is the use of caches at each processor, kept coherent by protocols implemented in hardware. We study the problem of testing shared memory multiprocessors to determine if they are indeed providing a sequentially consistent memory. We present a series of results for testing an execution of a shared memory under scenarios that exploit the cache-coherence protocol. In addition to reads and writes to the shared memory, we consider the more powerful read-modify-write, load-reserved, and store-conditional operations available in many cache-coherent multiprocessors. Finally, we consider linearizability, another well-known correctness condition for shared memories. Linearizability imposes additional restrictions on the shared memory, beyond that of sequential consistency; we show that these restrictions are useful in testing such memories.

    :abstractText: "The queue-read, queue-write (QRQW) PRAM model [GMR94] permits concurrent reading and writing, but at a cost proportional to the number of readers/writers to a memory location in a given step. The QRQW model reflects the contention properties of most parallel machines more accurately than either the well-studied CRCW or EREW models: the CRCW model does not adequately penalize algorithms with high contention to shared memory locations, while the EREW model is too strict in its insistence on zero contention at each step. Of primary practical and theoretical interest, then, is the design of fast and efficient QRQW algorithms for problems for which all previous algorithms either suffer from high contention, fail to be fast, or fail to be work-optimal. This paper describes low-contention, fast, work-optimal QRQW PRAM algorithms for the fundamental problems of finding a random permutation, parallel hashing, load balancing, and sorting. There is no known fast, work-optimal EREW algorithm known for finding a random permutation or for parallel hashing. For load balancing, we improve upon the EREW result whenever the ratio of the maximum to the average load is not too large. We show that the logarithmic dependence of the QRQW running time on this ratio is inherent by providing a matching lower bound. We demonstrate the performance advantage of a QRQW random permutation algorithm, compared with the popular EREW algorithm, by implementing and running both algorithms on the MasPar MP-1. Finally, we extend the work-time framework for the design of parallel algorithms to account for contention, and relate it to the QRQW PRAM model. We use our QRQW load balancing algorithm, as well as the QRQW linear compaction algorithm in [GMR94], to provide automatic tools for processor allocation&mdash;an issue that needs to be handled when translating an algorithm from its work-time presentation into the explicit PRAM description."

    :abstractText: Massive data sets often arise as physically distributed, parallel data streams. We present algorithms for estimating simple functions on the union of such data streams, while using only logarithmic space per stream. Each processor observes only its own stream, and communicates with the other processors only after observing its entire stream. This models the set-up in current network monitoring products. Our algorithms employ a novel coordinated sampling technique to extract a sample of the union; this sample can be used to estimate aggregate functions on the union. The technique can also be used to estimate aggregate functions over the distinct &ldquo;labels&rdquo; in one or more data streams, e.g., to determine the zeroth frequency moment (i.e., the number of distinct labels) in one or more data streams. Our space and time bounds are the best known for these problems, and our logarithmic space bounds for coordinated sampling contrast with polynomial lower bounds for independent sampling. We relate our distributed streams model to previously studied non-distributed (i.e., merged) streams models, presenting tight bounds on the gap between the distributed and merged models for deterministic algorithms.

    :abstractText: This paper presents algorithms for estimating aggregate functions over a "sliding window" of the N most recent data items in one or more streams. Our results include:<ol>For a single stream, we present the first &egr;-approximation scheme for the number of 1's in a sliding window that is optimal in both worst case time and space. We also present the first &egr; for the sum of integers in [0..R] in a sliding window that is optimal in both worst case time and space (assuming R is at most polynomial in N). Both algorithms are deterministic and use only logarithmic memory words.In contrast, we show that an deterministic algorithm that estimates, to within a small constant relative error, the number of 1's (or the sum of integers) in a sliding window over the union of distributed streams requires &OHgr;(N) space. We present the first randomized (&egr;,&sgr;)-approximation scheme for the number of 1's in a sliding window over the union of distributed streams that uses only logarithmic memory words. We also present the first (&egr;,&sgr;)-approximation scheme for the number of distinct values in a sliding window over distributed streams that uses only logarithmic memory words.</olOur results are obtained using a novel family of synopsis data structures.

    :abstractText: This paper formalizes and studies combinable memory-block transactions (MBTs). The idea is to encode short programs that operate on a single cache/memory block and then to specify such a program with a memory request. The code is then executed at the cache or memory controller, atomically with respect to other accesses to that block by this or other processors. The combinable form allows combining within the memory system or network. In addition to allowing for the standard set of read-modify-write operations (e.g., test-and-set, compare-and-swap, fetch-and-add), MBTs can be used to define other useful operations--such as a fetch-and-add that does not decrement below zero. We show how MBTs can be used to design simple and efficient implementations of a variety of protocols and algorithms, including a priority write, a semaphore with a non-blocking P operation, a bounded queue, and a timestamp-based transactional memory system. In all cases the protocols gain some advantage by using MBTs that are different from the standard set of operations. To gain an understanding of the efficiency that can be gained by using combining, we define a notion of bounded contention and show that all our protocols have bounded contention under arbitrary loads.

    :abstractText: Many commercial database systems maintain histograms to summarize the contents of large relations and permit efficient estimation of query result sizes for use in query optimizers. Delaying the propagation of database updates to the histogram often introduces errors into the estimation. This article presents new sampling-based approaches for incremental maintenance of approximate histograms. By scheduling updates to the histogram based on the updates to the database, our techniques are the first to maintain histograms effectively up to date at all times and avoid computing overheads when unnecessary. Our techniques provide highly accurate approximate histograms belonging to the equidepth and Compressed classes. Experimental results show that our new approaches provide orders of magnitude more accurate estimation than previous approaches.An important aspect employed by these new approaches is a backing sample, an up-to-date random sample of the tuples currently in a relation. We provide efficient solutions for maintaining a uniformly random sample of a relation in the presence of updates to the relation. The backing sample techniques can be used for any other application that relies on random samples of data.

    :abstractText: We demonstrate the design and an early prototype of IrisNet (Internet-scale Resource-Intensive Sensor Network services), a common, scalable networked infrastructure for deploying wide area sensing services. IrisNet is a potentially global network of smart sensing nodes, with webcams or other monitoring devices, and organizing nodes that provide the means to query recent and historical sensor-based data. IrisNet exploits the fact that high-volume sensor feeds are typically attached to devices with significant computing power and storage, and running a standard operating system. It uses aggressive filtering, smart query routing, and semantic caching to dramatically reduce network bandwidth utilization and improve query response times, as we demonstrate. Our demo will present two services built on Iris-Net, from two very different application domains. The first one, a parking space finder, utilizes webcams that monitor parking spaces to answer queries such as the availability of parking spaces near a user's destination. The second one, a distributed infrastructure monitor, uses measurement tools installed in individual nodes of a large distributed infrastructure to answer queries such as average network bandwidth usage of a set of nodes.

    :abstractText: Many high-level parallel programming languages allow for fine-grained parallelism. As in the popular work-time framework for parallel algorithm design, programs written in such languages can express the full parallelism in the program without specifying the mapping of program tasks to processors. A common concern in executing such programs is to schedule tasks to processors dynamically so as to minimize not only the execution time, but also the amount of space (memory) needed. Without careful scheduling, the parallel execution on p processors can use a factor of p or larger more space than a sequential implementation of the same program.This paper first identifies a class of parallel schedules that are provably efficient in both time and space. For any computation with w units of work and critical path length d, and for any sequential schedule that takes space s1, we provide a parallel schedule that takes fewer than w/p + d steps on p processors and requires less than s1 + p&dot;d space. This matches the lower bound that we show, and significantly improves upon the best previous bound of s1&dot;p spaces for the common case where d<<s1. The paper then describes a scheduler for implementing high-level languages with nested parallelism, that generates schedules in this class. During program execution, as the structure of the computation is revealed, the scheduler keeps track of the active tasks, allocates the tasks to the processors, and performs the necessary task synchronization. The scheduler is itself a parallel algorithm, and incurs at most a constant factor overhead in time and space, even when the scheduling granularity is individual units of work. The algorithm is the first efficient solution to the scheduling problem discussed here, even if space considerations are ignored.

    :abstractText: The queue-read, queue-write (QRQW) parallel random access machine (PRAM) model permits concurrent reading and writing to shared memory locations, but at a cost proportional to the number of readers/writers to any one memory location in a given step. The QRQW PRAM model reflects the contention properties of most commercially available parallel machines more accurately than either the well-studied CRCW PRAM or EREW PRAM models, and can be efficiently emulated with only logarithmic slowdown on hypercubetype non-combining networks. This paper describes fast, low-contention, work-optimal, randomized QRQW PRAM algorithms for the fundamental problems of load balancing, multiple compaction, generating a random permutation, parallel hashing, and distributive sorting. These logarithmic or sublogarithmic time algorithms considerably improve upon the best known EREW PRAM algorithms for these problems, while avoiding the high-contention steps typical of CRCW PRAM algorithms. An illustrative experiment demonstrates the performance advantage of a new QRQW random permutation algorithm when compared with the popular EREW algorithm. Finally, this paper presents new randomized algorithms for integer sorting and general sorting.

    :abstractText: There has been a great deal of interest recently in the development of general-purpose bridging models for parallel computation. Models such as the BSP and LogP have been proposed as more realistic alternatives to the widely-used PRAM model. The BSP and LogP models imply a rather different style for designing algorithms when compared to the PRAM model. Indeed, while many consider data parallelism as a convenient style, and the shared-memory abstraction as an easy-to-use platform, the bandwidth limitations of current machines have diverted much attention to message-passing and distributed-memory models (such as the BSP and LogP) that account more properly for these limitations. In this paper we consider the question of whether a shared-memory model can serve as an effective bridging model for parallel computation. In particular, can a shared-memory model be as effective as, say, the BSP? As a candidate for a bridging model, we introduce the Queuing Shared Memory (QSM) model, which accounts for limited communication bandwidth while still providing a simple shared-memory abstraction. We substantiate the ability of the QSM to serve as a bridging model by providing a simple work-preserving emulation of the QSM on both the BSP, and on a related model, the (d,x)-BSP. We present evidence that the features of the QSM are essential to its effectiveness as a bridging model. In addition, we describe scenarios in which the high-level QSM more accurately models certain machines than the more detailed BSP and LogP models. Finally, we present algorithmic results for the QSM, as well as general strategies for mapping algorithms designed for the BSP or PRAM models onto the QSM model. Our main conclusion is that shared-memory models can potentially serve as viable alternatives to existing message-passing, distributed-memory bridging models.

    :abstractText: Sequential consistency is the most widely used correctness condition for multiprocessor memory systems. This paper studies the problem of testing shared-memory multiprocessors to determine if they are indeed providing a sequentially consistent memory. It presents the first formal study of this problem, which has applications to testing new memory system designs and realizations, providing run-time fault tolerance, and detecting bugs in parallel programs.A series of results are presented for testing an execution of a shared memory under various scenarios, comparing sequential consistency with linearizability, another well-known correctness condition. Linearizability imposes additional restrictions on the shared memory, beyond that of sequential consistency; these restrictions are shown to be useful in testing such memories.

    :abstractText: "This paper introduces a cryptographic engine, Janus, which assists clients in establishing and maintaining secure and pseudonymous relationships with multiple servers. The setting is such that clients reside on a particular subnet (e.g., corporate intranet, ISP) and the servers reside anywhere on the Internet. The Janus engine allows each client-server relationship to use either weak or strong authentication on each interaction. At the same time, each interaction preserves privacy by neither revealing a clients true identity (except for the subnet) nor the set of servers with which a particular client interacts. Furthermore, clients do not need any secure long-term memory, enabling scalability and mobility. The interaction model extends to allow servers to send data back to clients via e-mail at a later date. Hence, our results complement the functionality of current network anonymity tools and remailers. The paper also describes the design and implementation of the Lucent Personalized Web Assistant (LPWA), which is a practical system that provides secure and pseudonymous relations with multiple servers on the Internet. LPWA employs the Janus function to generate site-specific person\xC2\x91, which consist of alias usernames, passwords, and e-mail addresses."

    :abstractText: Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of the wavelet decomposition in reducing large amounts of data to compact sets of wavelet coefficients (termed "wavelet synopses") that can be used to provide fast and reasonably accurate approximate query answers. A major shortcoming of these existing wavelet techniques is that the quality of the approximate answers they provide varies widely, even for identical queries on nearly identical values in distinct parts of the data. As a result, users have no way of knowing whether a particular approximate answer is highly-accurate or off by many orders of magnitude. In this article, we introduce Probabilistic Wavelet Synopses, the first wavelet-based data reduction technique optimized for guaranteed accuracy of individual approximate answers. Whereas previous approaches rely on deterministic thresholding for selecting the wavelet coefficients to include in the synopsis, our technique is based on a novel, probabilistic thresholding scheme that assigns each coefficient a probability of being included based on its importance to the reconstruction of individual data values, and then flips coins to select the synopsis. We show how our scheme avoids the above pitfalls of deterministic thresholding, providing unbiased, highly accurate answers for individual data values in a data vector. We propose several novel optimization algorithms for tuning our probabilistic thresholding scheme to minimize desired error metrics. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data sets evaluate these algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our probabilistic wavelet synopses in providing fast, highly accurate answers with improved quality guarantees.

    :abstractText: Many commercial database systems maintain histograms to summarize the contents of large relations and permit efficient estimation of query result sizes for use in query optimizers. Delaying the propagation of database updates to the histogram often introduces errors into the estimation. This article presents new sampling-based approaches for incremental maintenance of approximate histograms. By scheduling updates to the histogram based on the updates to the database, our techniques are the first to maintain histograms effectively up to date at all times and avoid computing overheads when unnecessary. Our techniques provide highly accurate approximate histograms belonging to the equidepth and Compressed classes. Experimental results show that our new approaches provide orders of magnitude more accurate estimation than previous approaches.An important aspect employed by these new approaches is a backing sample, an up-to-date random sample of the tuples currently in a relation. We provide efficient solutions for maintaining a uniformly random sample of a relation in the presence of updates to the relation. The backing sample techniques can be used for any other application that relies on random samples of data.

    :abstractText: Peer-to-peer and other decentralized, distributed systems are known to be particularly vulnerable to sybil attacks. In a sybil attack, a malicious user obtains multiple fake identities and pretends to be multiple, distinct nodes in the system. By controlling a large fraction of the nodes in the system, the malicious user is able to "out vote" the honest users in collaborative tasks such as Byzantine failure defenses. This paper presents SybilGuard, a novel protocol for limiting the corruptive influences of sybil attacks. Our protocol is based on the "social network" among user identities, where an edge between two identities indicates a human-established trust relationship. Malicious users can create many identities but few trust relationships. Thus, there is a disproportionately small "cut" in the graph between the sybil nodes and the honest nodes. SybilGuard exploits this property to bound the number of identities a malicious user can create. We show the effectiveness of SybilGuard both analytically and experimentally.

    :abstractText: Previous approaches for computing duplicate-sensitive aggregates in wireless sensor networks have used a tree topology, in order to conserve energy and to avoid double-counting sensor readings. However, a tree topology is not robust against node and communication failures, which are common in sensor networks. In this article, we present synopsis diffusion, a general framework for achieving significantly more accurate and reliable answers by combining energy-efficient multipath routing schemes with techniques that avoid double-counting. Synopsis diffusion avoids double-counting through the use of order- and duplicate-insensitive (ODI) synopses that compactly summarize intermediate results during in-network aggregation. We provide a surprisingly simple test that makes it easy to check the correctness of an ODI synopsis. We show that the properties of ODI synopses and synopsis diffusion create implicit acknowledgments of packet delivery. Such acknowledgments enable energy-efficient adaptation of message routes to dynamic message loss conditions, even in the presence of asymmetric links. Finally, we illustrate using extensive simulations the significant robustness, accuracy, and energy-efficiency improvements of synopsis diffusion over previous approaches.

    :abstractText: "For years, the computation rate of processors has been much faster than the access rate of memory banks, and this divergence in speeds has been constantly increasing in recent years. As a result, several shared-memory multiprocessors consist of more memory banks than processors. The object of this paper is to provide a simple model (with only a few parameters) for the design and analysis of irregular parallel algorithms that will give a reasonable characterization of performance on such machines. For this purpose, we extend Valiant's bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model with two parameters: a parameter for memory bank delay, the minimum time for servicing requests at a bank, and a parameter for memory bank expansion, the ratio of the number of banks to the number of processors. We call this model the (d, x)-BSP. We show experimentally that the (d, x)-BSP captures the impact of bank contention and delay on the CRAY C90 and J90 for irregular access patterns, without modeling machine-specific details of these machines. The model has clarified the performance characteristics of several unstructured algorithms on the CRAY C90 and J90, and allowed us to explore tradeoffs and optimizations for these algorithms. In addition to modeling individual algorithms directly, we also consider the use of the (d, x)-BSP as a bridging model for emulating a very high-level abstract model, the Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for emulating the EREW and QRQW PRAMs on the (d, x)-BSP."

    :abstractText: Advances in hardware and miniaturization technologies have led to a rapid increase in the number of large-scale sensor networkdeployments around the world, bringing us closer to the vision of a worldwide sensor web. Exploiting the sensor web to its fullpotential, however, raises several hard data management challenges. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted multidisciplinaryeffort encompassing many computer science fields. This article outlines some of the key data management challenges of a worldwide sensorweb. It also presents recent advances in data management research that aim to address these challenges. Hopefully, the scientific,ubiquitous computing, and sensor network communities will adopt some of these solutions for managing their data. The article alsoattempts to bring many of the remaining open issues to the attention of the database community. This article is part of a special issueon Building a Sensor-Rich World.

    :abstractText: "Recent advances in flash storage have made it an attractive alternative for data storage in a wide spectrum of computing devices, such as embedded sensors, mobile phones, PDA's, laptops, and even servers. However, flash storage has many unique characteristics that make existing data management/analytics algorithms designed for magnetic disks perform poorly with flash storage. For example, while random reads can be nearly as fast as sequential reads, random writes and in-place data updates are orders of magnitude slower than sequential writes. In this paper, we consider an important fundamental problem that would seem to be particularly challenging for flash storage: efficiently maintaining a very large random sample of a data stream (e.g., of sensor readings). First, we show that previous algorithms such as reservoir sampling and geometric file are not readily adapted to flash. Second, we propose B-File, an energy-efficient abstraction for flash storage to store self-expiring items, and show how a B-File can be used to efficiently maintain a large sample in flash. Our solution is simple, has a small (RAM) memory footprint, and is designed to cope with flash constraints in order to reduce latency and energy consumption. Third, we provide techniques to maintain biased samples with a B-File and to query the large sample stored in a B-File for a subsample of an arbitrary size. Finally, we present an evaluation with flash storage that shows our techniques are several orders of magnitude faster and more energy-efficient than (flash-friendly versions of) reservoir sampling and geometric file. A key finding of our study, of potential use to many flash algorithms beyond sampling, is that \"semi-random\" writes (as defined in the paper) on flash cards are over two orders of magnitude faster and more energy-efficient than random writes."

    :abstractText: Recommendation systems can be attacked in various ways, and the ultimate attack form is reached with a {\em sybil attack}, where the attacker creates a potentially unlimited number of {\em sybil identities} to vote. Defending against sybil attacks is often quite challenging, and the nature of recommendation systems makes it even harder. This paper presents {\em DSybil}, a novel defense for diminishing the influence of sybil identities in recommendation systems. DSybil provides strong provable guarantees that hold even under the worst-case attack and are optimal. DSybil can defend against an unlimited number of sybil identities over time. DSybil achieves its strong guarantees by i) exploiting the heavy-tail distribution of the typical voting behavior of the honest identities, and ii) carefully identifying whether the system is already getting ``enough help'' from the (weighted) voters already taken into account or whether more ``help'' is needed. Our evaluation shows that DSybil would continue to provide high-quality recommendations even when a million-node botnet uses an optimal strategy to launch a sybil attack.

    :abstractText: Cache-oblivious algorithms have the advantage of achieving good sequential cache complexity across all levels of a multi-level cache hierarchy, regardless of the specifics (cache size and cache line size) of each level. In this paper, we describe cache-oblivious sorting algorithms with optimal work, optimal cache complexity and polylogarithmic depth. Using known mappings, these lead to low cache complexities on shared-memory multiprocessors with a single level of private caches or a single shared cache. Moreover, the low cache complexities extend to shared-memory multiprocessors with common configurations of multi-level caches. The key factor in the low cache complexity on multiprocessors is the low depth of the algorithms we propose.

    :abstractText: Work stealing is a popular method of scheduling fine-grained parallel tasks. The performance of work stealing has been extensively studied, both theoretically and empirically, but primarily for the restricted class of nested-parallel (or fully strict) computations. We extend this prior work by considering a broader class of programs that also supports pipelined parallelism through the use of parallel futures. Though the overhead of work-stealing schedulers is often quantified in terms of the number of steals, we show that a broader metric, the number of deviations, is a better way to quantify work-stealing overhead for less restrictive forms of parallelism, including parallel futures. For such parallelism, we prove bounds on work-stealing overheads--scheduler time and cache misses--as a function of the number of deviations. Deviations can occur, for example, when work is stolen or when a future is touched. We also show instances where deviations can occur independently of steals and touches. Next, we prove that, under work stealing, the expected number of deviations is O(Pd + td) in a P-processor execution of a computation with span d and t touches of futures. Moreover, this bound is existentially tight for any work-stealing scheduler that is parsimonious (those where processors steal only when their queues are empty); this class includes all prior work-stealing schedulers. We also present empirical measurements of the number of deviations incurred by a classic application of futures, Halstead's quicksort, using our parallel implementation of ML. Finally, we identify a family of applications that use futures and, in contrast to quicksort, incur significantly smaller overheads.

    :abstractText: Online aggregation is a promising solution to achieving fast early responses for interactive ad-hoc queries that compute aggregates on a large amount of data. Essential to the success of online aggregation is a good non-blocking join algorithm that enables both (i) high early result rates with statistical guarantees and (ii) fast end-to-end query times. We analyze existing non-blocking join algorithms and find that they all provide sub-optimal early result rates, and those with fast end-to-end times achieve them only by further sacrificing their early result rates. We propose a new non-blocking join algorithm, Partitioned expanding Ripple Join (PR-Join), which achieves considerably higher early result rates than previous non-blocking joins, while also delivering fast end-to-end query times. PR-Join performs separate, ripple-like join operations on individual hash partitions, where the width of a ripple expands multiplicatively over time. This contrasts with the non-partitioned, fixed-width ripples of Block Ripple Join. Assuming, as in previous non-blocking join studies, that the input relations are in random order, PR-Join ensures representative early results that are amenable to statistical guarantees. We show both analytically and with real-machine experiments that PR-Join achieves over an order of magnitude higher early result rates than previous non-blocking joins. We also discuss the benefits of using a flash-based SSD for temporary storage, showing that PR-Join can then achieve close to optimal end-to-end performance. Finally, we consider the joining of finite data streams that arrive over time, and find that PR-Join achieves similar or higher result rates than RPJ, the state-of-the-art algorithm specialized for that domain.

    :abstractText: In this paper we explore a simple and general approach for developing parallel algorithms that lead to good cache complexity on parallel machines with private or shared caches. The approach is to design nested-parallel algorithms that have low depth (span, critical path length) and for which the natural sequential evaluation order has low cache complexity in the cache-oblivious model. We describe several cache-oblivious algorithms with optimal work, polylogarithmic depth, and sequential cache complexities that match the best sequential algorithms, including the first such algorithms for sorting and for sparse-matrix vector multiply on matrices with good vertex separators. Using known mappings, our results lead to low cache complexities on shared-memory multiprocessors with a single level of private caches or a single shared cache. We generalize these mappings to multi-level cache hierarchies of private or shared caches, implying that our algorithms also have low cache complexities on such hierarchies. The key factor in obtaining these low parallel cache complexities is the low depth of the algorithms we propose.

    :abstractText: Many different multi-agent problems, such as distributed scheduling, can be formalized as distributed constraint optimization problems (DCOP [1]). Ordering the constraint variables is an important preprocessing step of the ADOPT algorithm [1], the state of the art method of solving DCOP. Currently ADOPT uses depth-first search (DFS) trees for that purpose. For certain classes of tasks DFS ordering does not exploit the problem structure as compared to pseudo-tree ordering [3]. Also the variables are currently ordered by using a centralized scheme, which requires global information about the problem structure.We present a variable ordering algorithm, which is both decentralized and makes use of pseudo-trees, thus exploiting the problem structure when possible. This allows to apply ADOPT to domains, where global information is unavailable, and find solutions more efficiently. The worst-case pseudo-tree depth resulting from our algorithm is &radic;2k|V|, where V is the set of variables, and k is maximum cluster size in constraint graph. The algorithm has space and time complexity polynomial in size of the constraint graph.

    :abstractText: "We present a new polynomial-space algorithm for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization problems (DCOP). The algorithm, called NCBB, is branch and bound search with modifications for efficiency in a multiagent setting. Two main features of the algorithm are: (a) using different agents to search non-intersecting parts of a search space concurrently, and (b) communicating lower bounds on solution cost every time there is a possibility the bounds might change due to changed variable assignments. The first leads to a better utilization of computational resources of multiple participating agents, while the second provides for more efficient pruning of search space.Experimental results show that NCBB has significantly better performance than another polynomial-space algorithm, ADOPT, on random graph coloring problems. Under assumptions of cheap communication it also has comparable performance with DPOP despite using only polynomial memory as opposed to exponential memory for DPOP."

    :abstractText: A problem of planning for cooperative teams under uncertainty is a crucial one in multiagent systems. Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs) provide a convenient, but intractable model for specifying planning problems in cooperative teams. Compared to the single-agent case, an additional challenge is posed by the lack of free communication between the teammates. We argue, that acting close to optimally in a team involves a tradeoff between opportunistically taking advantage of agent's local observations and being predictable for the teammates. We present a more opportunistic version of an existing approximate algorithm for DEC-POMDPs and investigate the tradeoff. Preliminary evaluation shows that in certain settings oportunistic modification provides significantly better performance.

    :abstractText: This paper describes an initial attempt on a music-driven digital violinist (MDV) system, which automatically generates animation of a violinist based on violin music. MDV first analyzes the input audio signal and transcribes it into music notes. Next it uses the notes to synthesize the animated video of a violinist. Tests on the prototype system show that it achieves adequate visual realism and near real-time performance.

    :abstractText: Prompt feedback is essential for beginning violin learners; however, most amateur learners can only meet with teachers and receive feedback once or twice a week. To help such learners, we have attempted an initial design of Digital Violin Tutor (DVT), an integrated system that provides the much-needed feedback when human teachers are not available. DVT combines violin audio transcription with visualization. Our transcription method is fast, accurate, and robust again noise for violin audio recorded in home environments. The visualization is designed to be intuitive and easily understandable by people with little music knowledge. The different visualization modalities--video, 2D fingerboard animation, 3D avatar animation--help learners to practice and learn more effectively. The entire system has been implemented with off-the-shelf hardware and shown to be practical in home environments. In our user study, the system has received very positive evaluation.

    :abstractText: Protein conformational changes play a critical role in biological functions such as ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions. Due to the noise in structural data, determining salient conformational changes reliably and efficiently is a challenging problem. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for analyzing protein conformational changes, using noisy data. It applies a statistical flexibility test to all contiguous fragments of a protein and combines the information from these tests to compute a consensus flexibility measure for each residue of the protein. We tested the algorithm, using data from the Protein Data Bank and the Macromolecular Movements Database. The results show that our algorithm can reliably detect different types of salient conformational changes, including well-known examples such as hinge and shear, as well as the flap motion of HIV-1 protease. The software implementing our algorithm is available at http://motion.comp.nus.edu.sg/projects/ proflexana/proflexana.html.

    :abstractText: Parameter estimation of large bio-pathway models is an important and difficult problem. To reduce the prohibitive computational cost, one approach is to decompose a large model into components and estimate their parameters separately. However, the decomposed components often share common parts that may have conflicting parameter estimates, as they are computed independently within each component. In this paper, we propose to use a probabilistic inference technique called belief propagation to reconcile these independent estimates in a principled manner and compute new estimates that are globally consistent and fit well with data. An important advantage of our approach in practice is that it naturally handles incomplete or noisy data. Preliminary results based on synthetic data show promising performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

By invoking the laws of classical physics, we show that EEG dynamics obeys, at short enough times, a piece-wise quadratic Langevin equation characterized by an effective mass matrix, a piece-wise quadratic potential energy surface, a friction and random force matrix. In analyzing a sample seizure, we find with seizure onset a marked increase in the frequency of encounters with inflection points on the potential energy surface.

    :abstractText: The dynamics of microelectrode local field potentials from cortical slice cultures shows critical behavior. A desirable feature of criticality is that information transmission is optimal in this state. We explore a biologically plausible neural net model that can dynamically converge on criticality and that can return to criticality if perturbed away from it. Our model assumes the presence of a preferred target firing rate, with dynamical adjustments of internodal connection strengths to approach this firing rate. We suggest that mechanisms for maintaining firing rate homeostasis may also maintain a neural system at criticality.

    :abstractText: Sign language (SL) recognition modules in human-computer interaction systems need to be both fast and reliable. In cases where multiple sets of features are extracted from the SL data, the recognition system can speed up processing by taking only a subset of extracted features as its input. However, this should not be realised at the expense of a drop in recognition accuracy. By training different recognizers for different subsets of features, we can formulate the problem as the task of planning the sequence of recognizer actions to apply to SL data, while accounting for the trade-off between recognition speed and accuracy. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a principled mathematical framework for such planning problems. A POMDP explicitly models the probabilities of observing various outputs from the individual recognizers and thus maintains a probability distribution (or belief) over the set of possible SL input sentences. It then computes a policy that maps every belief to an action. This allows the system to select actions in real-time during online policy execution, adapting its behaviour according to the observations encountered. We illustrate the POMDP approach with a simple sentence recognition problem and show in experiments the advantages of this approach over "fixed action" systems that do not adapt their behaviour in real-time.

    :abstractText: Systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are often used to model the dynamics of complex biological pathways. We construct a discrete state model as a probabilistic approximation of the ODE dynamics by discretizing the value space and the time domain. We then sample a representative set of trajectories and exploit the discretization and the structure of the signaling pathway to encode these trajectories compactly as a dynamic Bayesian network. As a result, many interesting pathway properties can be analyzed efficiently through standard Bayesian inference techniques. We have tested our method on a model of EGF-NGF signaling pathway [1] and the results are very promising in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

    :abstractText: "We derive conditions which are both necessary and sufficient for the d-ary multi-log switching networks to be f-cast strictly nonblocking under all combinations of fanout and crosstalk constraints. The fanout constraint tells us which stage(s) of the networks has fanout capability. The crosstalk constraint tells us whether or not two routes are allowed to share a link, or are allowed to share a switching element (crosstalk-free or not). The most novel contribution of this paper is the analytical technique, which combines an algebraic view of the d-ary multi-log network with the max-flow min-cut theorem. Our results are more general than previously known results on several fronts: (a) d-ary networks are more general than binary networks, (b) f-cast covers both unicast (f = 1) and broadcast (f = N), (c) both link-blocking and node-blocking are considered in a unified manner, and (d) all combinations of fanout constraints are considered."

    :abstractText: Relatively little research has been published about bibliographic visualization, although scientists, researchers, and students often have need for such technology. In this paper, we examine the functionality needed to visualize bibliographies effectively. After reviewing some existing tools, we present BIVTECI (Bibliographic Visualization Tool with Enhanced Citation Interactivity) which derives from our analysis.Our main research goal is to capture the user-required relationships between bibliographic entries or articles. First, a user must understand the chronology of articles. Second, a userneeds to see the influence of articles on later work, i.e., the citation relationships. Third, the user wishes to group articles by specified attributes (e.g., title, author, keyword). Fourth, the user needs to examine information at varying levels of detail from general, multi-article views to specific, single-article ones. Finally, the user may need to use several information views simultaneously. We note that baseline functionality includes simple retrieval of entries by title, author, and keyword.The prototype BIVTECI tool demonstrates effective solutions for most of these requirements, combining information visualization with manipulation. The article proposes future research into features not yet implemented. BIVTECI is based on the Star data translator and the Landscape information visualizer, both developed at the University of Toronto.

    :abstractText: Network wide broadcasting is an energy intensive function. In this paper we propose a new method that performs transmission power adaptations based on information available locally, to reduce the overall energy consumed per broadcast. In most of the prior work on energy efficient broadcasting it is assumed that the originator of the broadcast has global networkinformation (both topology information as well as the geographical distance between nodes). This can be prohibitive in terms of the consumed overhead. In our protocol, each node attempts to tune its transmit power based on local information (of up to two hops from the transmitting node). We perform extensive simulations to evaluate our protocol. Our simulations take into account the possible loss of packets due to collision effects and the additional re-broadcasts that are necessary due to lower power transmissions.We show that our protocol achieves almost the same coverage as other non power-adaptive broadcast schemes but with a reduction of approximately 40 % in terms of the consumed power as compared to a scheme that does not adapt its power.

    :abstractText: "In a wormhole attack, wireless transmissions are recorded at one location and replayed at another, creating a virtual linkunder attacker control. Proposed countermeasures to this attack use tight clock synchronization, specialized hardware, oroverhearing, making them difficult to realize in practice. TrueLink is a timing based countermeasure to the wormhole attack.Using TrueLink, a node i can verify the existence of a direct link to an apparent neighbor, j. Verification of a link i \xC2\xBFj operates in two phases. In the rendezvous phase, the nodes exchange nonces \xC2\xBFj and \xCE\xB2i. This is done with tight timing constraints,within which it is impossible for attackers to forward the exchange between distant nodes. In the authentication phase, iand j transmit a signed message (\xC2\xBFj, \xCE\xB2i), mutually authenticating themselves as the originator of their respective nonce.TrueLink does not rely on precise clock synchronization, GPS coordinates, overhearing, geometric inconsistencies, or statisticalmethods. It can be implemented using only standard IEEE 802.11 hardware with a minor backwards compatible firmware update.TrueLink is meant to be used together with a secure routing protocol. Such protocols require an authentication mechanism,which will also be used by TrueLink. TrueLink is virtually independent of the routing protocol used. Our performance evaluationshows that TrueLink provides effective protection against potentially devastating wormhole attacks."

    :abstractText: Since Gallager, Humblet and Spira first introduced the distributed Minimum Spanning Tree problem, many authors have suggested ways to enhance their basic algorithm to improve its performance. Most of these improved algorithms have even been shown to be very efficient in terms of reducing their worst-case communications and/or time complexity measures. In this paper, however, we take a different approach, basing our comparisons on measurements of the actual running times, numbers of messages sent, etc., when various algorithms are run on large numbers of test networks. We also propose the Distributed Information idea, that yields several new techniques for performance improvement. Simulation results show that contrary to the theoretical analysis, some of the techniques in the literature degrade the performance. Moreover, a simple technique that we propose seems to achieve the best time and message complexity among several algorithms tested.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we measure and model the distribution of multicast group members. Multicast research has traditionally been plagued by a lack of real data and an absence of a systematic simulation methodology. Although temporal group properties have received some attention, the location of group members has not been measured and modelled. However, the placement of members can have significant impact on the design and evaluation of multicast schemes and protocols as shown in previous studies. In our work, we identify properties of members that reflect their spatial clustering and the correlation among them (such as participation probability, and pairwise correlation). Then, we obtain values for these properties by monitoring the membership of network games and large audio-video broadcasts from IETF and NASA. Finally, we provide a comprehensive model that can generate realistic groups. We evaluate our model against the measured data with excellent results. A realistic group membership model can help us improve the effectiveness of simulations and guide the design of group-communication protocols.

    :abstractText: Since the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the late '90s, P2P applications have multiplied, evolved and established themselves as the leading `growth app' of Internet traffic workload. In contrast to first-generation P2P networks which used well-defined port numbers, current P2P applications have the ability to disguise their existence through the use of arbitrary ports. As a result, reliable estimates of P2P traffic require examination of packet payload, a methodological landmine from legal, privacy, technical, logistic, and fiscal perspectives. Indeed, access to user payload is often rendered impossible by one of these factors, inhibiting trustworthy estimation of P2P traffic growth and dynamics. In this paper, we develop a systematic methodology to identify P2P flows at the transport layer, i.e., based on connection patterns of P2P networks, and without relying on packet payload. We believe our approach is the first method for characterizing P2P traffic using only knowledge of network dynamics rather than any user payload. To evaluate our methodology, we also develop a payload technique for P2P traffic identification, by reverse engineering and analyzing the nine most popular P2P protocols, and demonstrate its efficacy with the discovery of P2P protocols in our traces that were previously unknown to us. Finally, our results indicate that P2P traffic continues to grow unabatedly, contrary to reports in the popular media.

    :abstractText: "Monitoring network traffic and detecting unwanted applications has become a challenging problem, since many applications obfuscate their traffic using unregistered port numbers or payload encryption. Apart from some notable exceptions, most traffic monitoring tools use two types of approaches: (a) keeping traffic statistics such as packet sizes and interarrivals, flow counts, byte volumes, etc., or (b) analyzing packet content. In this paper, we propose the use of Traffic Dispersion Graphs (TDGs) as a way to monitor, analyze, and visualize network traffic. TDGs model the social behavior of hosts (\"who talks to whom\"), where the edges can be defined to represent different interactions (e.g. the exchange of a certain number or type of packets). With the introduction of TDGs, we are able to harness a wealth of tools and graph modeling techniques from a diverse set of disciplines."

    :abstractText: We revisit the problem of computing the path with the minimum cost in terms of the expected number of link layer retransmissions in wireless mesh networks. Unlike previous efforts (such as the popular ETX) we account for the fact that link layer protocols (such as the IEEE 802.11 MAC) incorporate a non-zero but finite number of retransmission attempts per packet. A key observation that motivates this work is that the performance of a path depends not only on the number of links on the path and their qualities, but also on the relative positions of the links on the path. In particular, the closer a lossy link to the destination, the higher is its impact on the performance of that path. We design a new path metricthat captures all of the above factors and we call this metric ETOP. In this paper, we provide a synopsis of the analytical computation of ETOP. We also implement a routing strategy based on ETOP on a 25-node experimental testbed and provide sample results to showcase the performance with ETOP.

    :abstractText: "Dense deployments of WLANs suffer from increased interference and as a result, reduced capacity. There are three main functions used to improve the overall network capacity: a) intelligent frequency allocation across APs, b) load-balancing of user affiliations across APs, and c) adaptive power-control for each AP. Several algorithms have been proposed in each category, but so far, their evaluation has been limited to: (a) each approach in isolation and, (b)simulations or small-scale testbeds. In this paper, we ask the question: what is the best way to combine these different functions? Our focus is to fully explore the interdependencies between the three functions in order to understand when and how to deploy them on a network. We follow a measurement-driven study to quantify the effects of three previously proposed optimization schemes (one for each category) on a relatively large testbed and in many different scenarios. Surprisingly, we find that blindly applying all the three optimization schemes is not always preferable; it can sometimes degrade the performance by as much as 24% compared to using only two of the schemes. We discover that there are explicit conditions that are conducive for applying specific combinations of the optimization schemes. We capture those conditions within a comprehensive framework, which we call MDG (Measurement-Driven Guidelines). While we derive suchguidelines based on measurements on one experimental testbed, we test their applicability and efficacy on a second testbed in a different location. We show that our framework improves network capacity consistently acrossboth testbeds, with improvements ranging from 22% to 142% with 802.11a, and 103% to 274% with 802.11g."

    :abstractText: We propose a methodology to simplify the analysis of wireless network simulations. Wireless simulation models are plagued by a vast parameter space. Consequently, performance studies are not easy to interpret or compare across different models. We reduce this parameter space by proposing a set of parameters that describe the network at a higher level of abstraction. More specifically, the cornerstone of our approach is the steady state utilization concept which quantifies the inherent capacity of a network to support a particular workload. The steady state utilization of a system is the maximum utilization with zero loss for a given traffic load. We also introduce the steady state arrival rate which is the arrival rate that keeps the network operating at its steady state utilization. Furthermore, we propose an efficient way to evaluate the performance of a network in terms of effective utilization which captures the utilization and the loss at the same time. Effective utilization measures the goodput of the network. Finally, as a case study, we use our methodology to evaluate how advance reservations affect network performance. We show how, contrary to intuition, bandwidth reservations can hurt performance, if we consider dropped calls as lost income.

    :abstractText: "In an effort to legally prosecute P2P users, the RIAA and MPAA have reportedly started to create decoy users: they participate in P2P networks in order to identify illegal sharing of content. This has reportedly scared some users who are afraid of being caught and prosecuted. The question we would like to answer is how prevalent is this phenomenon: how likely is it that a user will run into such a ''fake user'' and thus run the risk of a lawsuit? The first challenge is identifying these ''fake users''. We collect this information from a number of free open-source software projects which are trying to identify such addresses by forming the, so-called, blocklists. The second challenge is to quantify the probability of a user contacting such a fake user by conducting a large scale experiment in order to obtain reliable statistics. Using PlanetLab, we conduct active measurements, spanning a period of 90 days, from January to March 2006, spread over three continents. Analyzing over 100GB of TCP header data, we quantify the probability of a P2P user contacting fake users. We observe that 100% of our peers run into entities in these lists. In fact, 12-17% of all distinct IPs contacted by any node were listed on blocklists. Interestingly, a little caution can have significant effect: the top five most prevalent blocklisted IP ranges contribute to nearly 94% of all blocklisted IPs we ran into. Avoiding these can reduce the probability of a user being tracked to about 1%. In addition, we examine the identity of these blocklisted IPs. The majority of blocklisted IPs belong to the commercial and government domains and are nearly 2.5 times more than IPs belonging to educational, spyware or adware entities. Interestingly, less than 0.5% of all unique IPs contacted, belong explicitly to media companies. However, this may not be reassuring for P2P users, since the other blocklist users (government or commercial) could be collaborating with media companies."

    :abstractText: Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems have become ubiquitous and at present the BitTorrent (BT) based P2P systems are very popular and successful. It has been argued that this is mostly due to the Tit-For-Tat (TFT) strategy used in BT [1] that discourages free-ride behavior. However, Hale and Patarin [2] identify the weakness of TFT and hypothesize that it is possible to use multiple identities to cheat. To test this hypothesis we modify the official BT source code to allow the creation of multiple processes by one BT client. They use different identities to download the same file cooperatively. We experiment with several piece selection and sharing algorithms and show that BT is fairly robust to the exploitation of multiple identities except for one case. In most cases, the use of multiple identities does not provide siginificant speedup consistently. Interestingly, clients with multiple identities are still punished if they do not maintain a comparable upload rate with other normal clients. We attribute this to the robust way that the Tit-For-Tat policy works. From our experiments we observe that the BT protocol is rather resilient to exploits using multiple identities and it encourages self-regulation among BT clients.

Existing profiles are often narrowly focused in terms of the data they capture or the application they target. In this paper, we seek to design general end-host profiles capable of capturing and representing a broad range of user activity and behavior. We first present a novel methodology to profiling that uses a graph-based structure to represent and distill flow level information at the transport layer. Second, we develop mechanisms to: (a) summarize the information, and (b) adaptively evolve it over time.We conduct an initial study of our profiles on real user data, and observe that our method generates a compact, robust and intuitive description of user behavior."

    :abstractText: "The use of power control in wireless networks can lead to two conflicting effects. An increase in the transmission power on a link may (i) improve the quality and thus the throughput on that link but, (ii) increase the levels of interference on other links. A decrease in the transmission power can have the opposite effects. Our primary goal in this work is to understand the implications of power control on interference and contention. We conduct experiments on an indoor mesh network. Based on analysis of our experimental data, we identify three interference scenarios: a) the overlapping case, where the aggregate throughput achievable with two overlapping links cannot be improved via power control; b) the hidden terminal case, where proper power control can primarily improve fairness and, c) the potentially disjoint case, where proper power control can enable simultaneous transmissions and thus improve throughput dramatically. We find that power control can significantly improve overall throughput as well as fairness. However, to our surprise, we note that using virtual carrier sensing in conjunction with power control generally degrades performance, often to a large degree."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present, QoSMIC, a multicast protocol for the Internet that supports QoS-sensitive routing, and minimizes the importance of a priori configuration decisions (such as core selection). The protocol is resource-efficient, robust, flexible, and scalable. In addition, our protocol is provably loop-free.Our protocol starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) and individual receivers switch to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-Based Tree) when necessary. In both trees, the new destination is able to choose the most promising among several paths. An innovation is that we use dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchange protocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre-configuration decisions drastically, by separating the management from the data transfer functions; administrative routers are not necessarily part of the tree. This separation increases the robustness, and flexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adapt dynamically to the conditions of the network.The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas that make it more flexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many of the other protocols, (such as YAM, PIMSM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as special cases of QoSMIC. This paper presents the motivation behind, and the design of QoSMIC, and provides both analytical and experimental results to support our claims.

    :abstractText: We present a fundamentally different approach to classifying traffic flows according to the applications that generate them. In contrast to previous methods, our approach is based on observing and identifying patterns of host behavior at the transport layer. We analyze these patterns at three levels of increasing detail (i) the social, (ii) the functional and (iii) the application level. This multilevel approach of looking at traffic flow is probably the most important contribution of this paper. Furthermore, our approach has two important features. First, it operates in the dark, having (a) no access to packet payload, (b) no knowledge of port numbers and (c) no additional information other than what current flow collectors provide. These restrictions respect privacy, technological and practical constraints. Second, it can be tuned to balance the accuracy of the classification versus the number of successfully classified traffic flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three real traces. Our results show that we are able to classify 80%-90% of the traffic with more than 95% accuracy.

    :abstractText: "Application layer multicasting has emerged as an appealing alternative to network layer multicasting in wireline networks. Here, we examine the suitability of application layer multicast in ad hoc networks. To this effect, we propose a flexible receiver-driven overlay multicast protocol which we call Application Layer Multicast Algorithm (ALMA). ALMA constructs an overlay multicast tree in a dynamic, decentralized and incremental way. First, ALMA is receiver-driven: the member nodes find their connections according to their needs. Second, it is flexible, and thus, it can satisfy the performance goals and the needs of a wide range of applications. Third, it is highly adaptive: it reconfigures the tree in response to mobility or congestion. In addition, our protocol has the advantages of an application layer protocol: (a) simplicity of deployment, (b) independence from lower layer protocols, and (c) capability of exploiting features such as reliability and security that may be provided by the lower layers. Through extensive simulations, we show that ALMA performs favorably against the currently best application layer and network layer protocols. In more detail, we find that ALMA performs significantly better than ODMRP, a network layer, for small group sizes. We conclude that the application layer approach and ALMA seem very promising for ad hoc multicasting."

    :abstractText: "Motivation: Much research has been dedicated to large-scale protein interaction networks including the analysis of scale-free topologies, network modules and the relation of domain\xE2\x80\x93domain to protein\xE2\x80\x93protein interaction networks. Identifying locally significant proteins that mediate the function of modules is still an open problem. Method: We use a layered clustering algorithm for interaction networks, which groups proteins by the similarity of their direct neighborhoods. We identify locally significant proteins, called mediators, which link different clusters. We apply the algorithm to a yeast network. Results: Clusters and mediators are organized in hierarchies, where clusters are mediated by and act as mediators for other clusters. We compare the clusters and mediators to known yeast complexes and find agreement with precision of 71% and recall of 61%. We analyzed the functions, processes and locations of mediators and clusters. We found that 55% of mediators to a cluster are enriched with a set of diverse processes and locations, often related to translocation of biomolecules. Additionally, 82% of clusters are enriched with one or more functions. The important role of mediators is further corroborated by a comparatively higher degree of conservation across genomes. We illustrate the above findings with an example of membrane protein translocation from the cytoplasm to the inner nuclear membrane.

    :abstractText: "The paper provides an overview of the current available data sets for AS level topology and examines the usefulness and intuition of many and most widely used metrics used for graph analysis, and highlight some less known metrics. The paper makes two practical contributions.First, the paper highlights an important issue: all source of AS information are not the same. The paper utilizes three sources of information BGP tables, traceroute-based and archived information (WHOIS/IRR). The observed topo-logical properties are fairly different. A potential explanation could be that none of the sources captures the whole AS graph. Thus, the measurement community has more work to do to obtain a complete topology.Second, the paper critically analyzes the importance of the different topology metrics. The last six years have seen a proliferation of new metrics that are used in a selective fashion from researchers. This is one of the first thorough studies of most known metrics and on top of that many metrics that are used in related fields that also study networks (e.g. physics).In conclusion, this paper could become a reference point for making the analysis of the AS topology more systematic both in terms of making researchers: (a) aware of the differences among the datasets, and (b) careful in selecting metrics."

    :abstractText: The concepts of self-similarity, fractals, and long-range dependence (LRD) have revolutionized network modeling during the last decade. However, despite all the attention these concepts have received, they remain difficult to use by non-experts. This difficulty can be attributed to a relative complexity of the mathematical basis, the absence of a systematic approach to their application and the absence of publicly available software. In this paper, we introduce SELFIS, a comprehensive tool, to facilitate the evaluation of LRD by practitioners. Our goal is to create a stand-alone public tool that can become a reference point for the community. Our tool integrates most of the required functionality for an in-depth LRD analysis, including several LRD estimators. In addition, SELFIS includes a powerful approach to stress-test the existence of LRD, Using our tool, evidence are presented that the widely-used LRD estimators can provide misleading results. It is worth mentioning that 25 researchers have acquired SELFIS within a month of its release, which clearly demonstrates the need for such a tool.

If you don't have insider's information like Martha Stewart, the best indication is seeing whether people are trying to associate their names with it. For example, AI has seen some rough patches until Spielberg produced the movie that gave that community credibility. (I wonder if program managers are affected by movie critics and reviews? Oops, there goes my funding for the foreseeable future). Case in point, how many articles have you seen paying tributes to the "father of AI"? How many people do you hear in talks claiming that they were there when the A and the I were separate and they were among the first, but really the very first, to join the two letters together.

    :abstractText: The deployment of IP multicast support is impeded by several factors among which are the state scalability problem, the cumbersome management and routing, and the difficulty of supporting QoS. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called Aggregated QoS Multicast (AQoSM), to provide scalable and efficient QoS multicast in Diff-Serv networks. The key idea of AQoSM is to separate the concept of groups from the concept of distribution tree by ''mapping'' many groups to one distribution tree. In this way, multicast groups can now be routed and rerouted very quickly by assigning different labels (e.g., tree IDs) to the packets. Therefore, we can have load-balancing and dynamic rerouting to meet QoS requirements. In addition, the aggregation of groups on fewer trees leads to routing state reduction and less tree management overhead. Thus, AQoSM enables multicast to be seamlessly integrated into Diff-Serv without violating the design principle of Diff-Serv of keeping network core ''QoS stateless'' and without sacrificing the efficiency of multicast. Finally, efficient resource utilization and strong QoS support can be achieved through statistical multiplexing at the level of aggregated trees. We design a detailed MPLS-based AQoSM protocol with efficient admission control and MPLS multicast tree management. By simulation studies, we show that our protocol achieves significant multicast state reduction (up to 82%) and tree maintenance overhead reduction (up to 86%) with modest (12%) bandwidth overhead. It also reduces the blocking ratio of user requests with strong QoS requirements due to its load balancing and statistical multiplexing capabilities.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we develop methods to ''sample'' a small realistic graph from a large Internet topology. Despite recent activity, modeling and generation of realistic graphs resembling the Internet is still not a resolved issue. All previous work has attempted to grow such graphs from scratch. We address the complementary problem of shrinking an existing topology. In more detail, this work has three parts. First, we propose a number of reduction methods that can be categorized into three classes: (a) deletion methods, (b) contraction methods, and (c) exploration methods. We prove that some of them maintain key properties of the initial graph. We implement our methods and show that we can effectively reduce the nodes of an Internet graph by as much as 70% while maintaining its important properties. Second, we show that our reduced graphs compare favorably against construction-based generators. Finally, we successfully validate the effectiveness of our best methods in an actual performance evaluation study of multicast routing. Apart from its practical applications, the problem of graph sampling is of independent interest."

    :abstractText: "In group communications, we find that current multicast protocols are far from ''one size fits all'': they are typically geared towards and optimized for particular scenarios. As a result, when deployed in different scenarios, their performance and overhead often degrades significantly. A common problem is that most of these protocols incur high overheads with a high density of group members and in high mobility. Our objective is to design a protocol that adapts in response to the dynamics of the network. In particular, our objective is to provide efficient and lightweight multicast data dissemination irrespective of the density of group members and node density. Our work is motivated by two observations. First, broadcasting in some cases is more efficient than multicasting. Second, member and node layout distributions are not necessarily homogeneous. For example, many MANET applications result in a topological clustering of group members that move together. Thus, we develop Fireworks, an adaptive approach for group communications in mobile ad hoc networks. Fireworks is a hybrid 2-tier multicast/broadcast protocol that adapts to maintain performance given the dynamics of the network topology and group density. In a nutshell, our protocol creates pockets of broadcast distribution in areas with many members, while it develops a multicast backbone to interconnect these dense pockets. Fireworks offers packet delivery statistics comparable to that of a pure multicast scheme but with significantly lower overheads."

    :abstractText: "In an effort to legally prosecute P2P users, the RIAA and MPAA have reportedly started to create decoy users: they participate in P2P networks in order to identify illegal sharing of content. This has reportedly scared some users who are afraid of being caught and prosecuted. The question we would like to answer is how prevalent is this phenomenon: how likely is it that a user will run into such a ''fake user'' and thus run the risk of a lawsuit? The first challenge is identifying these ''fake users''. We collect this information from a number of free open-source software projects which are trying to identify such addresses by forming the, so-called, blocklists. The second challenge is to quantify the probability of a user contacting such a fake user by conducting a large scale experiment in order to obtain reliable statistics. Using PlanetLab, we conduct active measurements, spanning a period of 90 days, from January to March 2006, spread over three continents. Analyzing over 100GB of TCP header data, we quantify the probability of a P2P user contacting fake users. We observe that 100% of our peers run into entities in these lists. In fact, 12-17% of all distinct IPs contacted by any node were listed on blocklists. Interestingly, a little caution can have significant effect: the top five most prevalent blocklisted IP ranges contribute to nearly 94% of all blocklisted IPs we ran into. Avoiding these can reduce the probability of a user being tracked to about 1%. In addition, we examine the identity of these blocklisted IPs. The majority of blocklisted IPs belong to the commercial and government domains and are nearly 2.5 times more than IPs belonging to educational, spyware or adware entities. Interestingly, less than 0.5% of all unique IPs contacted, belong explicitly to media companies. However, this may not be reassuring for P2P users, since the other blocklist users (government or commercial) could be collaborating with media companies."

    :abstractText: In an earlier paper, Awerbuch presented an innovative distributed algorithm for solving minimum spanning tree (MST) problems that achieved optimal time and message complexity through the introduction of several advanced features. In this paper, we show that there are some cases where his algorithm can create cycles or fail to achieve optimal time complexity. We then show how to modify the algorithm to avoid these problems, and demonstrate both the correctness and optimality of the revised algorithm.

    :abstractText: Self-similarity and scaling phenomena have dominated Internet traffic analysis for the past decade. However, with the identification of long-range dependence (LRD) in network traffic, the research community has undergone a mental shift from Poisson and memory-less processes to LRD and bursty processes. Despite its widespread use, though, LRD analysis is hindered by our difficulty in actually identifying dependence and estimating its parameters unambiguously. The authors outline LRD findings in network traffic and explore the current lack of accuracy and robustness in LRD estimation.

    :abstractText: The goal of this paper is to develop a systematic approach to conducting simulations in wireless cellular networks. Performance analysis in such networks is a non-trivial task for the following reasons. First, there are a lot of parameters whose combined effect needs to be understood. Second, there are no benchmarks or widely accepted realistic values. As a result, different studies use different scenarios, and this makes the results of these studies incomparable. How can we make network scenarios and results easier to interpret and compare? We start with the observation that absolute parameter values are meaningless. Instead, we propose the use of relative parameters. These parameters combine multiple parameters into fewer parameters; e.g., user speed and diameter of cell are combined into the cell latency parameter. Thus, we reduce the total parameter space, but more importantly, we capture the combined effect of parameters that affect the performance. We show how using relative units of time and space and relative parameters such as cell latency and average number of cells visited can provide better insight than absolute parameters such as session duration or absolute units such as seconds, miles, etc. In addition, we propose the use of steady state utilization, a novel metric that captures the inherent capacity of a mobile network. We show that steady state utilization can become the reference point with which we can conduct meaningful simulations and interpret results more effectively. Finally, we describe a case study to illustrate our methodology. We evaluate the effect of bandwidth reservations on network performance. Our results show how reservations can actually hurt network performance.

    :abstractText: "We find that current group communications protocols are far from \"one size fits all,\xE2\x80\x9D they are typically geared toward and optimized for particular scenarios. Multicasting, in general, works well if the density of group members is sparse and in low mobility; broadcasting, in contrast, works well with a high density of group members and in high mobility. Due to the dynamics of the network, one strategy may be preferable to the other at different times and in different localized regions. In this paper, we first quantify the trade-offs between broadcasting and multicasting and evaluate the suitability of a strategy in various scenarios of deployment. Based on the lessons learned, we design a protocol that adapts in response to the dynamics of the network. We named our protocol Fireworks. Fireworks is a hybrid two-tier multicast/broadcast protocol that provides efficient and lightweight multicast dissemination and self-adapts in response to variations in the density and distribution of group members to provide efficient performance. Fireworks creates pockets of broadcast distribution in areas with many members, while it creates and maintains a multicast backbone to interconnect these dense pockets. Fireworks offers packet delivery statistics comparable to that of a pure multicast scheme but with significantly lower overheads. We also show that Fireworks has a lower level of degrading influence on the performance of coexisting unicast sessions than either traditional multicast or broadcast methods."

    :abstractText: "We propose a MAC protocol for use in multihop wireless networks that deploy an underlying UWB (Ultra Wide Band)-based physical layer. We consider a multiband approach to better utilize the available spectrum, where each transmitter sends longer pulses in one of many narrower frequency bands. The motivation comes from the observation that, in the absence of a sophisticated equalizer, the size of a slot for transmitting a UWB pulse is typically dictated by the delay spread of the channel. Therefore, using a wider frequency band to shorten the transmission time for each pulse does not increase the data rate in proportion to the available bandwidth. Our approach allows data transmissions to be contiguous and practically interference free, and, thus, highly efficient. For practicality, we ensure the conformance of our approach to FCC-imposed emission limits. We evaluate our approach via extensive simulations, and our results demonstrate the significant advantages of our approach over single-band solutions: The throughput increases significantly and the number of collisions decreases considerably. Finally, we analyze the behavior of our MAC protocol in a single-hop setting in terms of its efficiency in utilizing the multiple bands."

    :abstractText: Space-time communications can help combat fading and, hence, can significantly increase the capacity of ad hoc networks. Cooperative diversity or virtual antenna arrays facilitate spatio-temporal communications without actually requiring the deployment of physical antenna arrays. Virtual MISO entails the simultaneous transmission of appropriately encoded information by multiple nodes to effectively emulate a transmission on an antenna array. We present a novel multilayer approach for exploiting virtual MISO links in ad hoc networks. The approach spans the physical, medium access control and routing layers, and provides 1) a significant improvement in the end-to-end performance in terms of throughput and delay and 2) robustness to mobility and interference-induced link failures. The key physical layer property that we exploit is an increased transmission range due to achieved diversity gain. Except for space-time signal processing capabilities, our design does not require any additional hardware. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the benefits of our approach using virtual MISO links. As compared to using only SISO links, we achieve an increase of up to 150 percent in terms of the end-to-end throughput and a decrease of up to 75 percent in the incurred end-to-end delay. Our results also demonstrate a reduction in the route discovery attempts due to link failures by up to 60 percent, a direct consequence of the robustness that our approach provides to link failures.

    :abstractText: One of the main problems of the current Internet infrastructure is its inability to provide services at consistent quality-of-service (QoS) levels. At the same time, many emerging Internet applications, such as teleeducation, and teleconferencing, require multicast protocols that will provide the necessary QoS. In this paper, we propose QoSMIC, a multicast routing protocol for the Internet, that provides QoS-sensitive paths in a scalable, resource-efficient, and flexible way. QoSMIC differs from the previous protocols in that it identifies multiple paths and selects the one that can provide the required QoS. Two other key advantages of QoSMIC are its flexibility and adaptivity. First, the distribution tree does not have to be rooted at a preselected core router. Second, we can tradeoff between efficiency metrics depending on our needs; for example, we can tradeoff routing efficiency for a reduction in the control messages. Extensive simulations show that our protocol improves the resources utilization and the end-to-end performance compared to the current protocols. Specifically, our protocol reduces the call blocking probability by a factor of six and reduces the end-to-end delay by as much as 90% compared to the PIM protocol.

    :abstractText: It is well known that the current ad hoc protocol suites do not scale to work efficiently in networks of more than a few hundred nodes. Most current ad hoc routing architectures use flat static addressing and thus, need to keep track of each node individually, creating a massive overhead problem as the network grows. Could dynamic addressing alleviate this problem? In this paper, we argue that the use of dynamic addressing can enable scalable routing in ad hoc networks. We provide an initial design of a routing layer based on dynamic addressing, and evaluate its performance. Each node has a unique permanent identifier and a transient routing address, which indicates its location in the network at any given time. The main challenge is dynamic address allocation in the face of node mobility. We propose mechanisms to implement dynamic addressing efficiently. Our initial evaluation suggests that dynamic addressing is a promising approach for achieving scalable routing in large ad hoc and mesh networks.

    :abstractText: "Recent research on Internet traffic classification algorithms has yield a flurry of proposed approaches for distinguishing types of traffic, but no systematic comparison of the various algorithms. This fragmented approach to traffic classification research leaves the operational community with no basis for consensus on what approach to use when, and how to interpret results. In this work we critically revisit traffic classification by conducting a thorough evaluation of three classification approaches, based on transport layer ports, host behavior, and flow features. A strength of our work is the broad range of data against which we test the three classification approaches: seven traces with payload collected in Japan, Korea, and the US. The diverse geographic locations, link characteristics and application traffic mix in these data allowed us to evaluate the approaches under a wide variety of conditions. We analyze the advantages and limitations of each approach, evaluate methods to overcome the limitations, and extract insights and recommendations for both the study and practical application of traffic classification. We make our software, classifiers, and data available for researchers interested in validating or extending this work."

    :abstractText: The topology of the Internet at the Autonomous System (AS) level is not yet fully discovered despite significant research activity. The community still does not know how many links are missing, where these links are and finally, whether the missing links will change our conceptual model of the Internet topology. An accurate and complete model of the topology would be important for protocol design, performance evaluation and analyses. The goal of our work is to develop methodologies and tools to identify and validate such missing links between ASes. In this work, we develop several methods and identify a significant number of missing links, particularly of the peer-to-peer type. Interestingly, most of the missing AS links that we find exist as peer-to-peer links at the Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). First, in more detail, we provide a large-scale comprehensive synthesis of the available sources of information. We cross-validate and compare BGP routing tables, Internet Routing Registries, and traceroute data, while we extract significant new information from the less-studied Internet Exchange Points (IXPs). We identify 40% more edges and approximately 300% more peer-to-peer edges compared to commonly used data sets. All of these edges have been verified by either BGP tables or traceroute. Second, we identify properties of the new edges and quantify their effects on important topological properties. Given the new peer-to-peer edges, we find that for some ASes more than 50% of their paths stop going through their ISPs assuming policy-aware routing. A surprising observation is that the degree of an AS may be a poor indicator of which ASes it will peer with.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we study the impact of today's IT policies, defined based upon a monoculture approach, on the performance of endhost anomaly detectors. This approach leads to the uniform configuration of Host intrusion detection systems (HIDS) across all hosts in an enterprise networks. We assess the performance impact this policy has from the individual's point of view by analyzing network traces collected from 350 enterprise users. We uncover a great deal of diversity in the user population in terms of the "tail" behavior, i.e., the component which matters for anomaly detection systems. We demonstrate that the monoculture approach to HIDS configuration results in users that experience wildly different false positive and false negatives rates. We then introduce new policies, based upon leveraging this diversity and show that not only do they dramatically improve performance for the vast majority of users, but they also reduce the number of false positives arriving in centralized IT operation centers, and can reduce attack strength.

The point is that my call for poetry received a overwhelmingly enthusiastic response from at least five people. My mailbox was literally flooded (I have a small mailbox).

    :abstractText: We address the following questions. Is there link homophily in the application layer traffic? If so, can it be used to accurately classify traffic in network trace data without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level? Our research shows that the answers to both of these questions are affirmative in real network trace data. Specifically, we define link homophily to be the tendency for flows with common IP hosts to have the same application (P2P, Web, etc.) compared to randomly selected flows. The presence of link homophily in trace data provides us with statistical dependencies between flows that share common IP hosts. We utilize these dependencies to classify application layer traffic without relying on payloads or properties at the flow level. In particular, we introduce a new statistical relational learning algorithm, called Neighboring Link Classifier with Relaxation Labeling (NLC+RL). Our algorithm has no training phase and does not require features to be constructed. All that it needs to start the classification process is traffic information on a small portion of the initial flows, which we refer to as seeds. In all our traces, NLC+RL achieves above 90% accuracy with less than 5% seed size; it is robust to errors in the seeds and various seed-selection biases; and it is able to accurately classify challenging traffic such as P2P with over 90% Precision and Recall.

    :abstractText: Network traffic can be represented by a Traffic Dispersion Graph (TDG) that contains an edge between two nodes that send a particular type of traffic (e.g., DNS) to one another. TDGs have recently been proposed as an alternative way to interpret and visualize network traffic. Previous studies have focused on static properties of TDGs using graph snapshots in isolation. In this work, we represent network traffic with a series of related graph instances that change over time. This representation facilitates the analysis of the dynamic nature of network traffic, providing additional descriptive power. For example, DNS and P2P graph instances can appear similar when compared in isolation, but the way the DNS and P2P TDGs change over time differs significantly. To quantify the changes over time, we introduce a series of novel metrics that capture changes both in the graph structure (e.g., the average degree) and the participants (i.e., IP addresses) of a TDG. We apply our new methodologies to improve graph-based traffic classification and to detect changes in the profile of legacy applications (e.g., e-mail).

    :abstractText: Augmenting cellular networks with shorter multihop wireless links that carry traffic to/from a base station can be expected to facilitate higher rates and improved spatial reuse, therefore potentially yielding increased wireless capacity. The resulting network is referred to as a hybrid network. However, while this approach can result in shorter range higher rate links and improved spatial reuse, which together favor a capacity increase, it relies on multihop forwarding, which is detrimental to the overall capacity. In this paper, our objective is to evaluate the impact of these conflicting factors on the overall capacity of the hybrid network. We formally define the capacity of the network as the maximum possible downlink throughput under the constraint of max-min fairness. We analytically compute the capacity of both one- and two-dimensional hybrid networks with regular placement of base stations and users. While almost no capacity benefits are possible with linear networks due to poor spatial reuse, significant capacity improvements with two-dimensional networks are possible in certain parametric regimes. Our simulations also demonstrate that in both cases, if the users are placed randomly, the behavioral results are similar to those with regular placement of users.

    :abstractText: Given a snapshot of a social network, can we infer which new interactions among its members are likely to occur in the near future? We formalize this question as the link prediction problem, and develop approaches to link prediction based on measures the "proximity" of nodes in a network. Experiments on large co-authorship networks suggest that information about future interactions can be extracted from network topology alone, and that fairly subtle measures for detecting node proximity can outperform more direct measures.

    :abstractText: "The pages and hyperlinks of the World-Wide Web may be viewed as nodes and edges in a directed graph. This graph is a fascinating object of study: it has several hundred million nodes today, over a billion links, and appears to grow exponentially with time. There are many reasons -- mathematical, sociological, and commercial -- for studying the evolution of this graph. In this paper we begin by describing two algorithms that operate on the Web graph, addressing problems from Web search and automatic community discovery. We then report a number of measurements and properties of this graph that manifested themselves as we ran these algorithms on the Web. Finally, we observe that traditional random graph models do not explain these observations, and we propose a new family of random graph models. These models point to a rich new sub-field of the study of random graphs, and raise questions about the analysis of graph algorithms on the Web."

This improves the result of Aonuma et al., who show an upper bound of O(n3k4 log* k) for the complexity of such Voronoi diagrams. We then apply this result to the problem of finding the minimum Hausdorff distance between two point sets in the plane under Euclidean motion. We show that this distance can be computed in time O((m + n)6 log (mn)), where the two sets contain m and n points respectively.

    :abstractText: Network design is a fundamental problem for which it is important to understand the effects of strategic behavior. Given a collection of self-interested agents who want to form a network connecting certain endpoints, the set of stable solutions&mdash;the Nash equilibria&mdash;may look quite different from the centrally enforced optimum. We study the quality of the best Nash equilibrium, and refer to the ratio of its cost to the optimum network cost as the price of stability. The best Nash equilibrium solution has a natural meaning of stability in this context&mdash;it is the optimal solution that can be proposed from which no user will defect. We consider the price of stability for network design with respect to one of the most widely studied protocols for network cost allocation, in which the cost of each edge is divided equally between users whose connections make use of it; this fair-division scheme can be derived from the Shapley value and has a number of basic economic motivations. We show that the price of stability for network design with respect to this fair cost allocation is $O(\log k)$, where $k$ is the number of users, and that a good Nash equilibrium can be achieved via best-response dynamics in which users iteratively defect from a starting solution. This establishes that the fair cost allocation protocol is in fact a useful mechanism for inducing strategic behavior to form near-optimal equilibria. We discuss connections to the class of potential games defined by Monderer and Shapley, and extend our results to cases in which users are seeking to balance network design costs with latencies in the constructed network, with stronger results when the network has only delays and no construction costs. We also present bounds on the convergence time of best-response dynamics, and discuss extensions to a weighted game.

Our bounds are independent of the variances of the distributions; to the best of our knowledge, there were no previous algorithms knownwith provable learning guarantees for distributions having infinite variance and/or expectation. For Gaussians and log-concave distributions, our results match the best known sufficient separation conditions [1, 15]. Our algorithm requires a sample of size o(dk), where d is the number of dimensions and k is the number of distributions in the mixture.Wealso show that for isotropic power-laws, exponential, and Gaussian distributions, our separation condition is optimal up to a constant factor.

    :abstractText: "In recent years, gossip-based algorithms have gained prominence as a methodology for designing robust and scalable communication schemes in large distributed systems. The premise underlying distributed gossip is very simple: in each time step, each node v in the system selects some other node w as a communication partner \xC2\xBF generally by a simple randomized rule \xC2\xBF and exchanges information with w ; over a period of time, information spreads through the system in an \"epidemic fashion\".A fundamental issue which is not well understood is the following: how does the underlying low-level gossip mechanism \xC2\xBF the means by which communication partners are chosen \xC2\xBF affect one's ability to design efficient high-level gossip-based protocols? We establish one of the first concrete results addressing this question, by showing a fundamentallimitation on the power of the commonly used uniform gossip mechanism for solving nearest-resource location problems. In contrast, very efficient protocols for this problem can be designed using a non-uniform spatial gossip mechanism, as established in earlier work with Alan Demers.We go on to consider the design of protocols for more complex problems, providing an efficient distributed gossip-based protocol for a set of nodes in Euclidean space to construct an approximate minimum spanning tree. Here too, we establish a contrasting limitation on the power of uniform gossip for solving this problem. Finally, we investigate gossip-based packet routing as a primitive that underpins the communication patterns in many protocols, and as away to understand the capabilities of different gossip mechanisms at a general level."

    :abstractText: "Measuring the properties of a large, unstructured network can be difficult: one may not have full knowledge of the network topology, and detailed global measurements may be infeasible. A valuable approach to such problems is to take measurements from selected locations within the network and then aggregate them to infer large-scale properties. One sees this notion applied in settings that range from Internet topology discovery tools to remote software agents that estimate the download times of popular Web pages. Some of the most basic questions about this type of approach, however, are largely unresolved at an analytical level. How reliable are the results? How much does the choice of measurement locations affect the aggregate information one infers about the network? We describe algorithms that yield provable guarantees for a particular problem of this type: detecting a network failure. Suppose we want to detect events of the following form: an adversary destroys up to k nodes or edges, after which two subsets of the nodes, each at least an /spl epsi/ fraction of the network, are disconnected from one another. We call such an event an (/spl epsi/,k) partition. One method for detecting such events would be to place \"agents\" at a set D of nodes, and record a fault whenever two of them become separated from each other. To be a good detection set, D should become disconnected whenever there is an (/spl epsi/,k)-partition; in this way, it \"witnesses\" all such events. We show that every graph has a detection set of size polynomial in k and /spl epsi//sup -1/, and independent of the size of the graph itself. Moreover, random sampling provides an effective way to construct such a set. Our analysis establishes a connection between graph separators and the notion of VC-dimension, using techniques based on matchings and disjoint paths."

    :abstractText: A fundamental task for an autonomous mobile robot is that of localization-determining its location in a known environment. This problem arises in settings that range from the computer analysis of aerial photographs to the design of autonomous Mars rovers. L. Guibas et al. ((1992) have given geometric algorithms for the problem of enumerating locations for a robot consistent with a given view of the environment. We provide an on-line algorithm for a robot to move within its environment so as to uniquely determine its location. The algorithm improves asymptotically on strategies based purely on the "spiral search" technique of R. Baeza-Yates et al. (1993); an interesting feature of our approach is the way in which the robot is able to identify "critical directions" in the environment which allow it to perform late stages of the search more efficiently.

    :abstractText: "The max-flow min-cut theorem of Ford and Fulkerson is based on an even more foundational result, namely Menger's theorem on graph connectivity Menger's theorem provides a good characterization for the following single-source disjoint paths problem: given a graph G, with a source vertex s and terminals t1,...,tk, decide whether there exist edge-disjoint s-ti paths for i=1,...,k.We consider a natural, NP-hard generalization of this problem, which we call the single-source unsplittable flow problem. We are given a source and terminals as before; but now each terminal ti has a demand pi = 1, and each edge e of G has a capacity ce = 1. The problem is to decide whether one can choose a single s-ti path for each i, so that the resulting set of paths respects the capacity constraints-the total amount of demand routed across any edge e must be bounded by the capacity ce. The main results of this paper are constant-factor approximation algorithms for three natural optimization versions of this problem, in arbitrary directed and undirected graphs. The development of these algorithms requires a number of new techniques for rounding fractional solutions to network flow problems; for two of the three problems we consider, there were no previous techniques capable of providing an approximation in the general case, and for the third, the randomized rounding algorithm of Raghavan and Thompson provides a logarithmic approximation. Our techniques are also of interest from the perspective of a family of NP-hard load balancing and machine scheduling problems that can be reduced to the single-source unsplittable flow problem."

    :abstractText: "The concurrent growth of on-line communities exhibiting large-scale social structure, and of large decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing systems, has stimulated new interest in understanding networks of interacting agents as economic systems. Here we formulate a model for query incentive networks, motivated by such systems: users seeking information or services can pose queries, together with incentives for answering them, that are propagated along paths in a network. This type of information-seeking process can be formulated as a game among the nodes in the network, and this game has a natural Nash equilibrium. In such systems, it is a fundamental question to understand how much incentive is needed in order for a node to achieve a reasonable probability of obtaining an answer to a query from the network. We study the size of query incentives as a function both of the rarity of the answer and the structure of the underlying network. This leads to natural questions related to strategic behavior in branching processes. Whereas the classically studied criticality of branching processes is centered around the region where the branching parameter is 1, we show in contrast that strategic interaction in incentive propagation exhibits critical behavior when the branching parameter is 2."

    :abstractText: "Graph expansion has proved to be a powerful general tool for analyzing the behavior of routing algorithms and the inter-connection networks on which they run. We develop new routing algorithms and structural results for bounded-degree expander graphs. Our results are unified by the fact that they are all based upon, and extend, a body of work: asserting that expanders are rich in short, disjoint paths. In particular, our work has consequences for the disjoint paths problem, multicommodity flow, and graph minor containment. We show:(i) A greedy algorithm for approximating the maximum disjoint paths problem achieves a polylogarithmic approximation ratio in bounded-degree expanders. Although our algorithm is both deterministic and on-line, its performance guarantee is an improvement over previous bounds in expanders. (ii) For a multicommodity flow problem with arbitrary demands on a bounded-degree expander there is a (1 + )-optimal solution using only flow paths of polylogarithmic length. It follows that the multicommodity flow algorithm of Awerbuch and Leighton runs in nearly linear time per commodity in expanders. Our analysis is based on establishing the following: given edge weights on an expander G, one can increase some of the weights very slightly so the resulting shortest-path metric is smooth-the min-weight path between any pair of nodes uses a polylogarithmic number of edges. (iii) Every bounded-degree expander on n nodes contains every graph with O(n/log0(1) n) nodes and edges as a minor."

    :abstractText: "Concurrent with recent theoretical interest in the problem of metric embedding, a growing body of research in the networking community has studied the distance matrix defined by node-to-node latencies in the Internet, resulting in a number of recent approaches that approximately embed this distance matrix into low-dimensional Euclidean space. There is a fundamental distinction, however, between the theoretical approaches to the embedding problem and this recent Internet-related work: in addition to computational limitations, Internet measurement algorithms operate under the constraint that it is only feasible to measure a linear (or near-linear) number of node pairs, and typically in a highly structured way. Indeed, the most common framework for Internet measurements of this type is a beacon-based approach: one chooses uniformly at random a constant number of nodes (\xC3\xBDbeacons\xC3\xBD) in the network, each node measures its distance to all beacons, and one then has access to only these measurements for the remainder of the algorithm. Moreover, beacon-based algorithms are often designed not for embedding but for the more basic problem of triangulation, in which one uses the triangle inequality to infer the distances that have not been measured. Here we give algorithms with provable performance guarantees for beacon-based triangulation and embedding. We show that in addition to multiplicative error in the distances, performance guarantees for beacon-based algorithms typically must include a notion of slack \xC2\xBF a certain fraction of all distances may be arbitrarily distorted. For metrics of bounded doubling dimension (which have been proposed as a reasonable abstraction of Internet latencies), we show that triangulation-based reconstruction with a constant number of beacons can achieve multiplicative error 1 + \xC2\xBF on a 1 - \xC2\xBF fraction of distances, for arbitrarily small constants \xC2\xBF and \xC2\xBF. For this same class of metrics, we give a beacon-based embedding algorithm that achieves constant distortion on a 1- \xC2\xBF fraction of distances; this provides some theoretical justification for the success of the recent Global Network Positioning algorithm of Ng and Zhang, and it forms an interesting contrast with lower bounds showing that it is not possible to embed all distances in a doubling metric with constant distortion. We also give results for other classes of metrics, as well as distributed algorithms that require only a sparse set of distances but do not place too much measurement load on any one node."

    :abstractText: We consider the following maximum disjoint paths problem (MDPP). We are given a large network, and pairs of nodes that wish to communicate over paths through the network-the goal is to simultaneously connect as many of these pairs as possible in such a way that no two communication paths share an edge in the network. This classical problem has been brought into focus recently in papers discussing applications to routing in high-speed networks, where the current lack of understanding of the MDPP is an obstacle to the design of practical heuristics. We consider the class of densely embedded, nearly-Eulerian graphs, which includes the two-dimensional mesh and other planar and locally planar interconnection networks. We obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the maximum disjoint paths problem for this class of graphs; this improves on an O(log n)-approximation for the special case of the two-dimensional mesh due to Aumann-Rabani and the authors. For networks that are not explicitly required to be "high-capacity," this is the first constant-factor approximation for the MDPP in any class of graphs other than trees. We also consider the MDPP in the on-line setting, relevant to applications in which connection requests arrive over time and must be processed immediately. Here we obtain an asymptptically optimal O(log n)competitive on-line algorithm for the same class of graphs; this improves on an O(log n log log n) competitive algorithm for the special case of the mesh due to B. Awerbuch et al (1994).

    :abstractText: In a traditional classification problem, we wish to assign one of k labels (or classes) to each of n objects, in a way that is consistent with some observed data that we have about the problem. An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry, and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs - based on the individual choice of label we make for each object - and separation costs - based on the pair of choices we make for two "related" objects.We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial generalization of the multi-way cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated quadratic assignment problem.We provide the first non-trivial polynomial-time approximation algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main result is an O(log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which the labels are endowed with the uniform metric - all distances are the same - our methods provide a 2-approximation.

    :abstractText: In many optimization problems, one seeks to allocate a limited set of resources to a set of individuals with demands. Thus, such allocations can naturally be viewed as vectors, with one coordinate representing each individual. Motivated by work in network routing and bandwidth assignment, we consider the problem of producing solutions that simultaneously approximate all feasible allocations in a coordinate-wise sense. This is a very strong type of &ldquo;global&rdquo; approximation guarantee, and we explore its consequences in a wide range of discrete optimization problems, including facility location, scheduling, and bandwidth assignment in networks. A fundamental issue&mdash;one not encountered in the traditional design of approximation algorithms&mdash;is that good approximations in this global sense need not exist for every problem instance; there is no a priori reason why there should be an allocation that simultaneously approximates all others. As a result, the existential questions concerning such good allocations lead to a new perspective on a number of fundamental problems in resource allocation, and on the structure of their feasible solutions.

    :abstractText: In the ongoing movement toward socially-produced information resources, we are increasingly able to look through the content being created and see the individuals, incentives, and larger social processes at work. Designing and working with large-scale participatory social computing applications requires that we think not just about technological issues, but also about fundamental principles of human social interaction. Through the digital traces that these applications generate, we can begin to quantify and reason about such principles at unprecedented levels of scale and resolution. In this talk, we consider a crucial type of social process in this setting - the mechanisms by which information flows through groups of people engaged in sharing and synthesizing knowledge. As information, ideas, opinions, and beliefs spread through an underlying social network, their dynamics resemble that of an epidemic, moving "contagiously" from person to person. But social contagion is different from biological contagion in many respects; understanding the analogies and contrasts between these two kinds of processes leads us to consider the rich temporal characteristics of information flow within a network and the complex decision rules by which people choose to act on new information. The result is a richer picture of the communities that create knowledge and its interlinkages, and of the resources that ultimately arise from these processes.

    :abstractText: "The processes by which communities come together, attract new members, and develop over time is a central research issue in the social sciences - political movements, professional organizations, and religious denominations all provide fundamental examples of such communities. In the digital domain, on-line groups are becoming increasingly prominent due to the growth of community and social networking sites such as MySpace and LiveJournal. However, the challenge of collecting and analyzing large-scale time-resolved data on social groups and communities has left most basic questions about the evolution of such groups largely unresolved: what are the structural features that influence whether individuals will join communities, which communities will grow rapidly, and how do the overlaps among pairs of communities change over time.Here we address these questions using two large sources of data: friendship links and community membership on LiveJournal, and co-authorship and conference publications in DBLP. Both of these datasets provide explicit user-defined communities, where conferences serve as proxies for communities in DBLP. We study how the evolution of these communities relates to properties such as the structure of the underlying social networks. We find that the propensity of individuals to join communities, and of communities to grow rapidly, depends in subtle ways on the underlying network structure. For example, the tendency of an individual to join a community is influenced not just by the number of friends he or she has within the community, but also crucially by how those friends are connected to one another. We use decision-tree techniques to identify the most significant structural determinants of these properties. We also develop a novel methodology for measuring movement of individuals between communities, and show how such movements are closely aligned with changes in the topics of interest within the communities."

    :abstractText: "Models for the processes by which ideas and influence propagate through a social network have been studied in a number of domains, including the diffusion of medical and technological innovations, the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in game-theoretic settings, and the effects of \"word of mouth\" in the promotion of new products. Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks."

    :abstractText: A fundamental problem in text data mining is to extract meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time. E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise&mdash;that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a &ldquo;burst of activity,&rdquo; with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such &ldquo;bursts,&rdquo; in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions&semi; it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them.

    :abstractText: Social networks are of interest to researchers in part because they are thought to mediate the flow of information in communities and organizations. Here we study the temporal dynamics of communication using on-line data, including e-mail communication among the faculty and staff of a large university over a two-year period. We formulate a temporal notion of "distance" in the underlying social network by measuring the minimum time required for information to spread from one node to another - a concept that draws on the notion of vector-clocks from the study of distributed computing systems. We find that such temporal measures provide structural insights that are not apparent from analyses of the pure social network topology. In particular, we define the network backbone to be the subgraph consisting of edges on which information has the potential to flow the quickest. We find that the backbone is a sparse graph with a concentration of both highly embedded edges and long-range bridges - a finding that sheds new light on the relationship between tie strength and connectivity in social networks.

    :abstractText: "The profileration of rich social media, on-line communities, and collectively produced knowledge resources has accelerated the convergence of technological and social networks, producing environments that reflect both the architecture of the underlying information systems and the social structure on their members. In studying the consequences of these developments, we are faced with the opportunity to analyze social network data at unprecedented levels of scale and temporal resolution; this has led to a growing body of research at the intersection of the computing and social sciences. We discuss some of the current challenges in the analysis of large-scale social network data, focusing on two themes in particular: the inference of social processes from data, and the problem of maintaining individual privacy in studies of social networks. While early research on this type of data focused on structural questions, recent work has extended this to consider the social processes that unfold within the networks. Particular lines of investigation have focused on processes in on-line social systems related to communication [1, 22], community formation [2, 8, 16, 23], information-seeking and collective problem-solving [20, 21, 18], marketing [12, 19, 24, 28], the spread of news [3, 17], and the dynamics of popularity [29]. There are a number of fundamental issues, however, for which we have relatively little understanding, including the extent to which the outcomes of these types of social processes are predictable from their early stages (see e.g. [29]), the differences between properties of individuals and properties of aggregate populations in these types of data, and the extent to which similar social phenomena in different domains have uniform underlying explanations. The second theme we pursue is concerned with the problem of privacy. While much of the research on large-scale social systems has been carried out on data that is public, some of the richest emerging sources of social interaction data come from settings such as e-mail, instant messaging, or phone communication in which users have strong expectations of privacy. How can such data be made available to researchers while protecting the privacy of the individuals represented in the data? Many of the standard approaches here are variations on the principle of anonymization - the names of individuals are replaced with meaningless unique identifiers, so that the network structure is maintained while private information has been suppressed. In recent joint work with Lars Backstrom and Cynthia Dwork, we have identified some fundamental limitations on the power of network anonymization to ensure privacy [7]. In particular, we describe a family of attacks such that even from a single anonymized copy of a social network, it is possible for an adversary to learn whether edges exist or not between specific targeted pairs of nodes. The attacks are based on the uniqueness of small random subgraphs embedded in an arbitrary network, using ideas related to those found in arguments from Ramsey theory [6, 14]. Combined with other recent examples of privacy breaches in data containing rich textual or time-series information [9, 26, 27, 30], these results suggest that anonymization contains pitfalls even in very simple settings. In this way, our approach can be seen as a step toward understanding how techniques of privacy-preserving data mining (see e.g. [4, 5, 10, 11, 13, 15, 25] and the references therein) can inform how we think about the protection of eventhe most skeletal social network data."

    :abstractText: "A fundamental open question in the analysis of social networks is to understand the interplay between similarity and social ties. People are similar to their neighbors in a social network for two distinct reasons: first, they grow to resemble their current friends due to social influence; and second, they tend to form new links to others who are already like them, a process often termed selection by sociologists. While both factors are present in everyday social processes, they are in tension: social influence can push systems toward uniformity of behavior, while selection can lead to fragmentation. As such, it is important to understand the relative effects of these forces, and this has been a challenge due to the difficulty of isolating and quantifying them in real settings. We develop techniques for identifying and modeling the interactions between social influence and selection, using data from online communities where both social interaction and changes in behavior over time can be measured. We find clear feedback effects between the two factors, with rising similarity between two individuals serving, in aggregate, as an indicator of future interaction -- but with similarity then continuing to increase steadily, although at a slower rate, for long periods after initial interactions. We also consider the relative value of similarity and social influence in modeling future behavior. For instance, to predict the activities that an individual is likely to do next, is it more useful to know the current activities of their friends, or of the people most similar to them?"

    :abstractText: "The study of large-scale networks has emerged over the past several years as a theme that spans many disciplines, ranging from computing and information science to the social and biological sciences. Indeed, a shared interest in network structure is arguably one of the forces that is helping draw many of these disciplines closer together. As one aspect of this broader theme, we consider a convergence of ideas taking place at the boundary between distributed computer networks and human social networks --- the former consisting of computing devices linked by an underlying communication medium, and the latter consisting of people and organizations in society connected by ties that represent friendship, interaction, and influence.Distributed computing systems have long been intertwined with the social networks that link their user populations. Recent developments, however, have added further dimensions to this relationship: the growth of blogging, social networking services, and other forms of social media on the Internet have made large-scale social networks more transparent to the general public than ever before. They have also raised new research challenges at the interface of computer science and the social sciences --- challenges in which the study of distributed computing has the potential to provide considerable insight.We discuss three related areas that illustrate the issues at this interface. The first is centered around the small-world phenomenon --- the premise that most pairs of individuals in a social network are linked by very short paths (or \"six degrees of separation\") [36]. In earlier work, we proposed that the social-psychology experiments providing the first empirical evidence for the phenomenon [25, 35] were related in fundamental ways to the problem of decentralized routing [14], and this theme has been pursued in a number of subsequent papers (e.g. [5, 8, 15, 17, 24, 29, 31, 32]). This line of research has helped to abstract some of the general principles underlying random graphs in which decentralized routing and search are feasible --- structures in which local information is sufficient to reach designated targets in the network. In the process, close connections have been developed to research in the design of decentralized peer-to-peer systems [3, 20, 21, 22, 23], and some of the patterns suggested by the basic models of small-world networks have been borne out to a striking extent by empirical studies of social network structure [2, 19].As a second area, we consider cascading behavior and the diffusion of information in networks. Rumors, fads, innovations, social movements, and diseases spread through human social networks [9, 28, 30, 33] in much the way that information propagates through a distributed system. And as with small-world networks, the analogies between the computational and social versions of these phenomena turn out to be deep rather than superficial. One of the oldest connections here was the pioneering work on epidemic algorithms presented by Demers et al. at PODC 1987 [6], in which probabilistic rules for information dissemination in distributed systems are modeled on aspects of biological epidemics (see [12] for a recent overview of this topic). Recent work has exploited similar analogies in the development of viral marketing strategies to promote new innovations by word-of-mouth effects [7, 13, 18, 27], in the growth of on-line communities and social networking sites [4], and in the analysis of information cascades among weblogs [1, 10].Finally, we consider game-theoretic models for these types of search and diffusion processes. The use of game theory to analyze networks of interacting strategic agents has become an active area of research in computer science (see e.g. [11, 26, 34]); in the present context we can ask how the introduction of economic incentives affects the performance of decentralized search or information diffusion algorithms. In particular, if the intermediaries on a path from a query to an answer require compensation for their participation in the search, then the dynamics of the system depend crucially on both the structure of the network and on the rarity of the answer; the resulting analysis leads to natural questions related to strategic behavior in branching processes [16]."

    :abstractText: The shared-memory model of computation typically provides processes with an arbitrary number of copies of the available object types; yet a simple argument shows that any consensus protocol can only make use of some finite subset of these. Thus we believe it is useful to consider the problem of consensus from the point of view of resource bounds, determining whether consensus can still be solved when the number of copies of the system''s shared objects is limited. This approach leads to a general technique which we call the combination protocol, in which the number of processes that can achieve consensus with a given object increases as more copies of it are made available. Such a phenomenon brings up questions about the robustness of Herlihy''s consensus hierarchy, in that objects are being combined to solve $n$-process consensus, even though no single copy can do so individually. We show how the ideas in the combination protocol appear even in situations where objects are not explicitly being combined with one another; we also consider the general question of resource bounds in several known consensus protocols. We analyze two such protocols that use seemingly similar primitives, achieving a substantial improvement in one case and showing a tight lower bound in the other.

    :abstractText: "We study the problem of auditing databases which support statistical sum queries to protect the security of sensitive information; we focus on the special case in which the sensitive information is Boolean. Principles and techniques developed for the security of statistical databases in the case of continuous attributes do not apply here. We prove certain strong complexity results suggesting that there is no general efficient solution for the auditing problem in this case. We propose two efficient algorithms: The first is applicable when the sum queries are one-dimensional range queries (we prove that the problem is NP-hard even in the two-dimensional case). The second is an approximate algorithm that maintains security, although it may be too restrictive. Finally, we consider a \"dual\" variant, with continuous data but an aggregate function that is combinatorial in nature. Specifically, we provide algorithms for two natural definitions of the auditing condition when the aggregate function is MAX."

    :abstractText: "Protein sequence design is a natural inverse problem to protein structure prediction: given a target structure in three dimensions, we wish to design an amino acid sequence that is likely fold to it. A model of Sun, Brem, Chan, and Dill casts this problem as an optimization on a space of sequences of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) monomers; the goal is to find a sequence which achieves a dense hydrophobic core with few solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues. Sun et al. developed a heuristic method to search the space of sequences, without a guarantee of optimality or near-optimality; Hart subsequently raised the computational tractability of constructing an optimal sequence in this model as an open question. Here we resolve this question by providing an efficient algorithm to construct optimal sequences; our algorithm has a polynomial running time, and performs very efficiently in practice. We illustrate the implementation of our method on structures drawn from the Protein Data Bank. We also consider extensions of the model to larger amino acid alphabets, as a way to overcome the limitations of the binary H/P alphabet. We show that for a natural class of arbitrarily large alphabets, it remains possible to design optimal sequences efficiently. Finally, we analyze some of the consequences of this sequence design model for the study of evolutionary fitness landscapes. A given target structure may have many sequences that are optimal in the model of Sun et al.; following a notion raised by the work of J. Maynard Smith, we can ask whether these optimal sequences are ``connected'''' by successive point mutations. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide this connectedness property, relative to a given target structure. We develop the algorithm by first solving an analogous problem expressed in terms of submodular functions, a fundamental object of study in combinatorial optimization."

    :abstractText: In nature, one finds large collections of different protein sequences exhibiting roughly the same three-dimensional structure, and this observation underpins the study of structural protein families. In studying such families at a global level, a natural question to ask is how close to "optimal" the native sequences are in terms of their energy. We therefore define and compute the evolutionary capacity of a protein structure as the total number of sequences whose energy in the structure is below that of the native sequence. An important aspect of our definition is that we consider the space of all possible protein sequences, i.e. the exponentially large set of all strings over the 20-letter amino acid alphabet, rather than just the set of sequences found in nature.In order to make our approach computationally feasible, we develop randomized algorithms that perform approximate enumeration in sequence space with provable performance guarantees. We draw on the area of rapidly mixing Markov chains, by exhibiting a connection between the evolutionary capacity of proteins and the number of feasible solutions to the Knapsack problem. This connection allows us to design an algorithm for approximating the evolutionary capacity, extending a recent result of Morris and Sinclair on the Knapsack problem. We present computational experiments that show the method to be effective in practice on large collections of protein structures. In addition, we show how to use approximations to the evolutionary capacity to compute a statistical mechanics notion of "evolutionary temperature" on sequence space.

    :abstractText: A collaborative filtering system analyzes data on the past behavior of its users so as to make recommendations --- a canonical example is the recommending of books based on prior purchases. The full potential of collaborative filtering implicitly rests on the premise that, as an increasing amount of data is collected, it should be possible to make increasingly high-quality recommendations. Despite the prevalence of this notion at an informal level, the theoretical study of such convergent algorithms has been quite limited.To investigate such algorithms, we generalize a model of collaborative filtering proposed by Kumar et al., in which the recommendations made by an algorithm are compared to those of an omniscient algorithm that knows the hidden preferences of users. Within our generalized model, we develop a recommendation algorithm with a strong convergence property --- as the amount of data increases, the quality of its recommendations approach those of the optimal omniscient algorithm. We also consider a further generalization, a mixture model proposed by Hofmann and Puzichaomt; here we prove that, in a natural sense, no recommendation algorithm can achieve convergent behavior with respect to the optimum.

    :abstractText: "In many settings, competing technologies -- for example, operating systems, instant messenger systems, or document formats -- can be seen adopting a limited amount of compatibility with one another; in other words, the difficulty in using multiple technologies is balanced somewhere between the two extremes of impossibility and effortless interoperability. There are a range of reasons why this phenomenon occurs, many of which -- based on legal, social, or business considerations -- seem to defy concise mathematical models. Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in purely strategic terms. Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who are currently users of technology B. We consider several ways of capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or -- at an extra cost -- adopt both A and B. We characterize how the ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced within a narrow, intermediate range. We also extend the framework to the case of multiple technologies, where we find that a simple model captures the phenomenon of two firms adopting a limited \"strategic alliance\" to defend against a new, third technology."

    :abstractText: In a wide range of markets, individual buyers and sellers often trade through intermediaries, who determine prices via strategic considerations. Typically, not all buyers and seller shave access to the same intermediaries, and they trade at correspondingly different prices that reflect their relative amounts of power in the market. We model this phenomenon using a game in which buyers, sellers, and traders engage in trade on a graph that represents the access each buyer and seller has to the traders. In this model, traders set prices strategically, and then buyers and sellers react to the prices they are offered. We show that the resulting game always has a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, and that all equilibria lead to an efficient (i.e. socially optimal) allocation of goods. We extend these results to a more general type of matching market, such as one finds in the matching ofjob applicants and employers. Finally, we consider how the profits obtained by the traders depend on the underlying graph -- roughly, a trader cancommand a positive profit if and only if it has an "essential" connection in the network structure, thus providing a graph-theoretic basis for quantifying the amount of competition among traders. Our work differs from recent studies of how price is affected by network structure through our modeling of price-setting as a strategic activity carried out by a subset of agents in the system, rather than studying prices set via competitive equilibrium or by a truthful mechanism.

    :abstractText: A fundamental principle in social network research is that individuals can benefit from serving as intermediaries between others who are not directly connected. Through such intermediation, they potentially can broker the flow of information and synthesize ideas arising in different parts of the network. These principles form the underpinning for the theory of structural holes, which studies the ways in which individuals, particularly in organizational settings, fill the "holes" between people or groups that are not otherwise interacting. We apply a game-theoretic approach to this notion, studying the structures that evolve when individuals in a social network have incentives to form links that bridge otherwise disconnected parties. We model payoffs as a trade-off between the benefits of connecting non-neighboring nodes, and the cost, in effort, to maintain links - including settings where the costs are non-uniform to reflect the increased difficulty in spanning different parts of a hierarchical organization. We find, both through theoretical results and computational experiments, that the equilibrium networks in this model have rich combinatorial structure, and capture qualitative observations arising in the study of structural holes. In particular, even in completely symmetric settings, individuals will differentiate themselves in equilibrium, occupying different social strata and receiving correspondingly different payoffs.

    :abstractText: "The role of network structure has grown in significance over the past ten years in the field of information retrieval, stimulated to a great extent by the importance of link analysis in the development of Web search techniques [4]. This body of work has focused primarily on the network that is most clearly visible on the Web: the network of hyperlinks connecting documents to documents. But the Web has always contained a second network, less explicit but equally important, and this is the social network on its users, with latent person-to-person links encoding a variety of relationships including friendship, information exchange, and influence. Developments over the past few years --- including the emergence of social networking systems and rich social media, as well as the availability of large-scale e-mail and instant messenging datasets --- have highlighted the crucial role played by on-line social networks, and at the same time have made them much easier to uncover and analyze. There is now a considerable opportunity to exploit the information content inherent in these networks, and this prospect raises a number of interesting research challenge.Within this context, we focus on some recent efforts to formalize the problem of searching a social network. The goal is to capture the issues underlying a variety of related scenarios: a member of a social networking system such as MySpace seeks a piece of information that may be held by a friend of a friend [27, 28]; an employee in a large company searches his or her network of colleagues for expertise in a particular subject [9]; a node in a decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries for a file that is likely to be a small number of hops away [2, 6, 16, 17]; or a user in a distributed IR or federated search setting traverses a network of distributed resources connected by links that may not just be informational but also economic or contractual [3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 18, 21]. In their most basic forms, these scenarios have some essential features in common: a node in a network, without global knowledge, must find a short path to a desired \"target\" node (or to one of several possible target nodes).To frame the underlying problem, we go back to one of the most well-known pieces of empirical social network analysis --- Stanley Milgram's research into the small-world phenomenon, also known as the \"six degrees of separation\" [19, 24, 25]. The form of Milgram's experiments, in which randomly chosen starters had to forward a letter to a designated target individual, established not just that short chains connecting far-flung pairs of people are abundant in large social networks, but also that the individuals in these networks, operating with purely local information about their own friends and acquaintances, are able to actually find these chains [10]. The Milgram experiments thus constituted perhaps the earliest indication that large-scale social networks are structured to support this type of decentralized search. Within a family of random-graph models proposed by Watts and Strogatz [26], we have shown that the ability of a network to support this type of decentralized search depends in subtle ways on how its \"long-range\" connections are correlated with the underlying spatial or organizational structure in which it is embedded [10, 11]. Recent studies using data on communication within organizations [1] and the friendships within large on-line communities [15] have established the striking fact that real social networks closely match some of the structural features predicted by these mathematical models.If one looks further at the on-line settings that provide the initial motivation for these issues, there is clearly interest from many directions in their long-term economic implications --- essentially, the consequences that follow from viewing distributed information retrieval applications, peer-to-peer systems, or social-networking sites as providing marketplaces for information and services. How does the problem of decentralized search in a network change when the participants are not simply agents following a fixed algorithm, but strategic actors who make decisions in their own self-interest, and may demand compensation for taking part in a protocol? Such considerations bring us into the realm of algorithmic game theory, an active area of current research that uses game-theoretic notions to quantify the performance of systems in which the participants follow their own self-interest [20, 23] In a simple model for decentralized search in the presence of incentives, we find that performance depends crucially on both the rarity of the information and the richness of the network topology [12] --- if the network is too structurally impoverished, an enormous investment may be required to produce a path from a query to an answer."

    :abstractText: An important problem in VLSI design is distributing a clock signal to synchronous elements in a VLSI circuit so that the signal arrives at all elements simultaneously. The signal is distributed by means of a clock routing tree rooted at a global clock source. The difference in length between the longest and shortest root-leaf path is called the skew of the tree. The problem is to construct a clock tree with zero skew (to achieve synchronicity) and minimal sum of edge lengths (so that circuit area and clock tree capacitance are minimized).We give the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for this problem and its variants that arise in the VLSI context. For the zero skew problem in general metric spaces, we give an approximation algorithm with a performance guarantee of 2e. For the L1 version on the plane, we give an (8/ln 2)-approximation algorithm.

    :abstractText: The network structure of a hyperlinked environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have effective means for understanding it. We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of context on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of &ldquo;authorative&rdquo; information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of &ldquo;hub pages&rdquo; that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis.

    :abstractText: The study of random graphs has traditionally been dominated by the closely-related models G(n, m), in which a graph is sampled from the uniform distribution on graphs with n vertices and m edges, and G(n, p), in which each of the (n/2) edges is sampled independently with probability p. Recently, however, there has been considerable interest in alternate random graph models designed to more closely approximate the properties of complex real-world networks such as the Web graph, the Internet, and large social networks. Two of the most well-studied of these are the closely related "preferential attachment" and "copying" models, in which vertices arrive one-by-one in sequence and attach at random in "rich-get-richer" fashion to d earlier vertices.Here we study the infinite limits of the preferential attachment process --- namely, the asymptotic behavior of finite graphs produced by preferential attachment (brie y, PA graphs), as well as the infinite graphs obtained by continuing the process indefinitely. We are guided in part by a striking result of Erd&ouml;;s and R&eacute;nyi on countable graphs produced by the infinite analogue of the G(n, p) model, showing that any two graphs produced by this model are isomorphic with probability 1; it is natural to ask whether a comparable result holds for the preferential attachment process.We find, somewhat surprisingly, that the answer depends critically on the out-degree d of the model. For d = 1 and d = 2, there exist infinite graphs R&infin;d such that a random graph generated according to the infinite preferential attachment process is isomorphic to R&infin;d with probability 1. For d &ge; 3, on the other hand, two different samples generated from the infinite preferential attachment process are non-isomorphic with positive probability. The main technical ingredients underlying this result have fundamental implications for the structure of finite PA graphs; in particular, we give a characterization of the graphs H for which the expected number of subgraph embeddings of H in an n-node PA graph remains bounded as n goes to infinity.

    :abstractText: "In many models of optical routing, we are given a set of communication paths in a network, and we must assign a wavelength to each path so that paths sharing an edge receive different wavelengths. The goal is to assign as few wavelengths as possible, in order to make as efficient use as possible of the optical bandwidth. Wilfong and Winkler considered the problem of placing wavelength converters in such a network: if a node of the network contains a converter, any path that passes through this node may change its wavelength. Having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing, down to the following natural {\\em congestion bound}: even with converters, we will always need at least as many wavelengths as the maximum number of paths sharing a single edge. Thus Winkler and Wilfong defined a set $S$ of nodes in a network to be {\\em sufficient} if, placing converters at the nodes in $S$, every set of paths can be routed with a number of wavelengths equal to its congestion bound. They showed that finding a sufficient set of minimum size is NP-complete. In this paper, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find a sufficient set for an arbitrary directed network whose size is within a factor of $2$ of minimum. For the special case of planar graphs with bi-directional edges, we obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme. Our techniques establish a connection between the problem of finding a minimum sufficient set and an interesting simultaneous generalization of the Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set problems in undirected graphs."

    :abstractText: "We consider a model for monitoring the connectivity of a network subject to node or edge failures. In particular, we are concerned with detecting (\xCE\xB5, k)-failures: events in which an adversary deletes up to network elements (nodes or edges), after which there are two sets of nodes A and B, each at least an \xCE\xB5 fraction of the network, that are disconnected from one another. We say that a set D of nodes is an (\xCE\xB5 k)-detection set if, for any (\xCE\xB5 k)-failure of the network, some two nodes in D are no longer able to communicate; in this way, D \"witnesses\" any such failure. Recent results show that for any graph G, there is an is (\xCE\xB5 k)-detection set of size bounded by a polynomial in k and \xCE\xB5, independent of the size of G.In this paper, we expose some relationships between bounds on detection sets and the edge-connectivity &lambda; and node-connectivity &kappa; of the underlying graph. Specifically, we show that detection set bounds can be made considerably stronger when parameterized by these connectivity values. We show that for an adversary that can delete &kappa;&lambda; edges, there is always a detection set of size O((&kappa;/\xCE\xB5) log (1/\xCE\xB5)) which can be found by random sampling. Moreover, an (\xCE\xB5, &lambda)-detection set of minimum size (which is at most 1/\xCE\xB5) can be computed in polynomial time. A crucial point is that these bounds are independent not just of the size of G but also of the value of &lambda;.Extending these bounds to node failures is much more challenging. The most technically difficult result of this paper is that a random sample of O((&kappa;/\xCE\xB5) log (1/\xCE\xB5)) nodes is a detection set for adversaries that can delete a number of nodes up to &kappa;, the node-connectivity.For the case of edge-failures we use VC-dimension techniques and the cactus representation of all minimum edge-cuts of a graph; for node failures, we develop a novel approach for working with the much more complex set of all minimum node-cuts of a graph."

    :abstractText: "Random geometric graphs have been one of the fundamental models for reasoning about wireless networks: one places n points at random in a region of the plane (typically a square or circle), and then connects pairs of points by an edge if they are within a fixed distance of one another. In addition to giving rise to a range of basic theoretical questions, this class of random graphs has been a central analytical tool in the wireless networking community. For many of the primary applications of wireless networks, however, the underlying environment has a large number of obstacles, and communication can only take place among nodes when they are close in space and when they have line-of-sight access to one another \xE2\x80\x93 consider, for example, urban settings or large indoor environments. In such domains, the standard model of random geometric graphs is not a good approximation of the true constraints, since it is not designed to capture the line-of-sight restrictions. Here we propose a random-graph model incorporating both range limitations and line-of-sight constraints, and we prove asymptotically tight results for k-connectivity. Specifically, we consider points placed randomly on a grid (or torus), such that each node can see up to a fixed distance along the row and column it belongs to. (We think of the rows and columns as \xE2\x80\x98streets\xE2\x80\x99 and \xE2\x80\x98avenues\xE2\x80\x99 among a regularly spaced array of obstructions.) Further, we show that when the probability of node placement is a constant factor larger than the threshold for connectivity, near-shortest paths between pairs of nodes can be found, with high probability, by an algorithm using only local information. In addition to analysing connectivity and k-connectivity, we also study the emergence of a giant component, as well an approximation question, in which we seek to connect a set of given nodes in such an environment by adding a small set of additional \xE2\x80\x98relay\xE2\x80\x99 nodes."

    :abstractText: A number of basic models for VLSI layout are based on the construction of node-disjoint paths between terminals on a multilayer grid. In this setting, one is interested in minimizing both the number of layers required and the area of the underlying grid. Building on work of Cutler and Shiloach [ Networks, 8 (1978), pp. 253--278], Aggarwal et al. [ Proc. 26th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science , Portland, OR, 1985; Algorithmica, 6 (1991), pp. 241--255], and Aggarwal, Klawe, and Shor [ Algorithmica}, 6 (1991), pp. 129--151], we prove an upper-bound trade-off between these two quantities in a general multilayer grid model. As a special case of our main result, we obtain significantly improved bounds for the problem of routing a full permutation on the mesh using node-disjoint paths; our new bound here is within polylogarithmic factors of the bisection bound. Our algorithms involve some new techniques for analyzing the structure of node-disjoint paths in planar graphs and indicate some respects in which this problem, at least in the planar case, is fundamentally different from its edge-disjoint counterpart.

    :abstractText: In the dynamic load balancing problem, we seek to keep the job load roughly evenly distributed among the processors of a given network. The arrival and departure of jobs is modeled by an adversary restricted in its power. Muthukrishnan and Rajaraman [An adversarial model for distributed dynamic load balancing, in Proceedings of the 10th ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures, ACM, New York, 1998] gave a clean characterization of a restriction on the adversary that can be considered the natural analogue of a cut condition. They proved that a simple local balancing algorithm proposed by Aiello et al. [Approximate load balancing on dynamic and asynchronous networks, in Proceedings of the 25th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, ACM, New York, 1993] is stable against such an adversary if the insertion rate is restricted to a $(1-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the cut size. They left as an open question whether the algorithm is stable at rate 1. In this paper, we resolve this question positively, by proving stability of the local algorithm at rate 1. Our proof techniques are very different from the ones used by Muthukrishnan and Rajaraman and yield a simpler proof and tighter bounds on the difference in loads. In addition, we introduce a multicommodity version of this load balancing model and show how to extend the result to the case of balancing two different kinds of loads at once (obtaining as a corollary a new proof of the 2-commodity Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem). We also show how to apply the proof techniques to the problem of routing packets in adversarial systems. Awerbuch et al. [Simple routing strategies for adversarial systems, in Proceedings of the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE Computer Society, Los Alamitos, CA, 2001] showed that the same load balancing algorithm is stable against an adversary, inserting packets at rate 1 with a single destination in dynamically changing networks. Our techniques give a much simpler proof for a different model of adversarially changing networks.

    :abstractText: A number of current technologies allow for the determination of interatomic distance information in structures such as proteins and RNA. Thus, the reconstruction of a three-dimensional set of points using information about its interpoint distances has become a task of basic importance in determining molecular structure. The distance measurements one obtains from techniques such as NMR are typically sparse and error-prone, greatly complicating the reconstruction task. Many of these errors result in distance measurements that can be safely assumed to lie within certain fixed tolerances. But a number of sources of systematic error in these experiments lead to inaccuracies in the data that are very hard to quantify; in effect, one must treat certain entries of the measured distance matrix as being arbitrarily &ldquo;corrupted.&rdquo;The existence of arbitrary errors leads to an interesting sort of error-correction problem&mdash;how many corrupted entries in a distance matrix can be efficiently corrected to produce a consistent three-dimensional structure? For the case of an n &times; n matrix in which every entry is specified, we provide a randomized algorithm running in time O(n log n) that enumerates all structures consistent with at most (1/2-&egr;)n errors per row, with high probability. In the case of randomly located errors, we can correct errors of the same density in a sparse matrix-one in which only a &bgr; fraction of the entries in each row are given, for any constant &bgr;gt;0.

    :abstractText: We consider packet routing when packets are injected continuously into a network. We develop an adversarial theory of queuing aimed at addressing some of the restrictions inherent in probabilistic analysis and queuing theory based on time-invariant stochastic generation. We examine the stability of queuing networks and policies when the arrival process is adversarial, and provide some preliminary results in this direction. Our approach sheds light on various queuing policies in simple networks, and paves the way for a systematic study of queuing with few or no probabilistic assumptions.

    :abstractText: "The dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information. Gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches.In many settings --- consider a network of sensors, or a cluster of distributed computing hosts --- new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we propose distance-based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip algorithms: a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d, and is independent of the size of the network.For nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip algorithms that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distance \\DIST, with high probability, in O(\\log^{1 + \\ve} \\DIST) time steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, and deterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our algorithms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. We show an application of our gossip algorithms to a basic resource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly"

    :abstractText: "Many network problems are based on fundamental relationships involving time. Consider, for example, the problems of modeling the flow of information through a distributed network, studying the spread of a disease through a population, or analyzing the reachability properties of an airline timetable. In such settings, a natural model is that of a graph in which each edge is annotated with a time label specifying the time at which its endpoints \"communicated.\" We will call such a graph a temporal network. To model the notion that information in such a network \"flows\" only on paths whose labels respect the ordering of time, we call a path time-respecting if the time labels on its edges are non-decreasing. The central motivation for our work is the following question: how do the basic combinatorial and algorithmic properties of graphs change when we impose this additional temporal condition? The notion of a path is intrinsic to many of the most fundamental algorithmic problems on graphs; spanning trees, connectivity, flows, and cuts are some examples. When we focus on time-respecting paths in place of arbitrary paths, many of these problems acquire a character that is different from the traditional setting, but very rich in its own right. We provide results on two types of problems for temporal networks. First, we consider connectivity problems, in which we seek disjoint time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. The natural analogue of Menger's Theorem for node-disjoint paths fails in general for time-respecting paths; we give a non-trivial characterization of those graphs for which the theorem does hold in terms of an excluded subdivision theorem, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for connectivity on this class of graphs. (The problem on general graphs is NP-complete.) We then define and study the class of inference problems, in which we seek to reconstruct a partially specified time labeling of a network in a manner consistent with an observed history of information flow."

    :abstractText: "Long a matter of folklore, the ``small-world phenomenon'''' --the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances --was inaugurated as an area of experimental study in the social sciences through the pioneering work of Stanley Milgram in the 1960''s. This work was among the first to make the phenomenon quantitative, allowing people to speak of the ``six degrees of separation'''' between any two people in the United States. Since then, a number of network models have been proposed as frameworks in which to study the problem analytically. One of the most refined of these models was formulated in recent work of Watts and Strogatz; their framework provided compelling evidence that the small-world phenomenon is pervasive in a range of networks arising in nature and technology, and a fundamental ingredient in the evolution of the World Wide Web. But existing models are insufficient to explain the striking algorithmic component of Milgram''s original findings: that individuals using local information are collectively very effective at actually constructing short paths between two points in a social network. Although recently proposed network models are rich in short paths, we prove that no decentralized algorithm, operating with local information only, can construct short paths in these networks with non-negligible probability. We then define an infinite family of network models that naturally generalizes the Watts-Strogatz model, and show that for one of these models, there is a decentralized algorithm capable of finding short paths with high probability. More generally, we provide a strong characterization of this family of network models, showing that there is in fact a unique model within the family for which decentralized algorithms are effective."

For any classical optimization problem, the corresponding segmentation problem seeks to partition a set of cost vectors into several segments, so that the overall cost is optimized. We focus on two natural and interesting (but MAXSNP-complete) problems in this class, the hypercube segmentation problem and the catalog segmentation problem, and present approximation algorithms for them. We also present a general greedy scheme, which can be specialized to approximate any segmentation problem.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we undertake the first study of statistical multiplexing from the perspective of approximation algorithms. The basic issue underlying statistical multiplexing is the following: in high-speed networks, individual connections (i.e., communication sessions) are very bursty, with transmission rates that vary greatly over time. As such, the problem of packing multiple connections together on a link becomes more subtle than in the case when each connection is assumed to have a fixed demand.We consider one of the most commonly studied models in this domain: that of two communicating nodes connected by a set of parallel edges, where the rate of each connection between them is a random variable. We consider three related problems: (1) stochastic load balancing, (2) stochastic bin-packing, and (3) stochastic knapsack. In the first problem the number of links is given and we want to minimize the expected value of the maximum load. In the other two problems the link capacity and an allowed overflow probability p are given, and the objective is to assign connections to links, so that the probability that the load of a link exceeds the link capacity is at most $p$. In bin-packing we need to assign each connection to a link using as few links as possible. In the knapsack problem each connection has a value, and we have only one link. The problem is to accept as many connections as possible.For the stochastic load balancing problem we give an O(1)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary random variables. For the other two problems we have algorithms restricted to on-off sources (the most common special case studied in the statistical multiplexing literature), with a somewhat weaker range of performance guarantees.A standard approach that has emerged for dealing with probabilistic resource requirements is the notion of effective bandwidth---this is a means of associating a fixed demand with a bursty connection that \"represents\" its distribution as closely as possible. Our approximation algorithms make use of the standard definition of effective bandwidth and also a new one that we introduce; the performance guarantees are based on new results showing that a combination of these measures can be used to provide bounds on the optimal solution."

    :abstractText: A collaborative filtering system at an e-commerce site or similar service uses data about aggregate user behavior to make recommendations tailored to specific user interests. We develop recommendation algorithms with provable performance guarantees in a probabilistic mixture model for collaborative filtering proposed by Hoffman and Puzicha. We identify certain novel parameters of mixture models that are closely connected with the best achievable performance of a recommendation algorithm; we show that for any system in which these parameters are bounded, it is possible to give recommendations whose quality converges to optimal as the amount of data grows.All our bounds depend on a new measure of independence that can be viewed as an L1-analogue of the smallest singular value of a matrix. Using this, we introduce a technique based on generalized pseudoinverse matrices and linear programming for handling sets of high-dimensional vectors. We also show that standard approaches based on L2-spectral methods are not strong enough to yield comparable results, thereby suggesting some inherent limitations of spectral analysis.

By &ldquo;categorical data,&rdquo; we mean tables with fields that cannot be naturally ordered by a metric &ndash; e.g., the names of producers of automobiles, or the names of products offered by a manufacturer. Our approach is based on an iterative method for assigning and propagating weights on the categorical values in a table; this facilitates a type of similarity measure arising from the co-occurrence of values in the dataset. Our techniques can be studied analytically in terms of certain types of non-linear dynamical systems.

    :abstractText: Local aspects of Web search - associating Web content and queries with geography - is a topic of growing interest. However, the underlying question of how spatial variation is manifested in search queries is still not well understood. Here we develop a probabilistic framework for quantifying such spatial variation; on complete Yahoo! query logs, we find that our model is able to localize large classes of queries to within a few miles of their natural centers based only on the distribution of activity for the query. Our model provides not only an estimate of a query's geographic center, but also a measure of its spatial dispersion, indicating whether it has highly local interest or broader regional or national appeal. We also show how variations on our model can track geographically shifting topics over time, annotate a map with each location's "distinctive queries", and delineate the "spheres of influence" for competing queries in the same general domain.

    :abstractText: We investigate how to organize a large collection of geotagged photos, working with a dataset of about 35 million images collected from Flickr. Our approach combines content analysis based on text tags and image data with structural analysis based on geospatial data. We use the spatial distribution of where people take photos to define a relational structure between the photos that are taken at popular places. We then study the interplay between this structure and the content, using classification methods for predicting such locations from visual, textual and temporal features of the photos. We find that visual and temporal features improve the ability to estimate the location of a photo, compared to using just textual features. We illustrate using these techniques to organize a large photo collection, while also revealing various interesting properties about popular cities and landmarks at a global scale.

    :abstractText: "There are many on-line settings in which users publicly express opinions. A number of these offer mechanisms for other users to evaluate these opinions; a canonical example is Amazon.com, where reviews come with annotations like \"26 of 32 people found the following review helpful.\" Opinion evaluation appears in many off-line settings as well, including market research and political campaigns. Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally different from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, \"What did Y think of X?\", we are asking, \"What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?\" Here we develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a large-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We find that the perceived helpfulness of a review depends not just on its content but also but also in subtle ways on how the expressed evaluation relates to other evaluations of the same product. As part of our approach, we develop novel methods that take advantage of the phenomenon of review \"plagiarism\" to control for the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we provide a simple and natural mathematical model consistent with our findings. Our analysis also allows us to distinguish among the predictions of competing theories from sociology and social psychology, and to discover unexpected differences in the collective opinion-evaluation behavior of user populations from ifferent countries."

    :abstractText: "The Web is a hypertext body of approximately 300 million pages that continues to grow at roughly a million pages per day. Page variation is more prodigious than the data's raw scale: Taken as a whole, the set of Web pages lacks a unifying structure and shows far more authoring style and content variation than that seen in traditional text-document collections. This level of complexity makes an \"off-the-shelf\" database-management and information-retrieval solution impossible. To date, index-based search engines for the Web have been the primary tool by which users search for information. Such engines can build giant indices that let you quickly retrieve the set of all Web pages containing a given word or string. Experienced users can make effective use of such engines for tasks that can be solved by searching for tightly constrained keywords and phrases. These search engines are, however, unsuited for a wide range of equally important tasks. In particular, a topic of any breadth will typically contain several thousand or million relevant Web pages. How then, from this sea of pages, should a search engine select the correct ones-those of most value to the user?"

    :abstractText: A fundamental problem in text data mining is to extract meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time. E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise&mdash;that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a &ldquo;burst of activity,&rdquo; with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such &ldquo;bursts,&rdquo; in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions&semi; it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them.

    :abstractText: We consider the class of balancing algorithms for two servers. Such algorithms have appeared in a number of the early papers on this problem; they are so named because they seek to ``balance'''' the distance travelled evenly among the servers. In this paper, we show a universal lower bound on the competitive ratio of any balancing algorithm for two servers. The lower bound is equal to (5 + $\sqrt{7}$)/2 ($\sim$ 3.82), and consequently shows that no optimal on-line algorithm for two servers can be expressed as a balancing algorithm.

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we analyze the behavior of packet-switched communication networks in which packets arrive dynamically at the nodes and are routed in discrete time steps across the edges. We focus on a basic adversarial model of packet arrival and path determination for which the time-averaged arrival rate of packets requiring the use of any edge is limited to be less than 1. This model can reflect the behavior of connection-oriented networks with transient connections (such as ATM networks) as well as connectionless networks (such as the Internet). We concentrate on greedy (also known as work-conserving) contention-resolution protocols. A crucial issue that arises in such a setting is that of stability&mdash;will the number of packets in the system remain bounded, as the system runs for an arbitrarily long period of time? We study the universal stability of network (i.e., stability under all greedy protocols) and universal stability of protocols (i.e., stability in all networks). Once the stability of a system is granted, we focus on the two main parameters that characterize its performance: maximum queue size required and maximum end-to-end delay experienced by any packet. Among other things, we show: (i) There exist simple greedy protocols that are stable for all networks. (ii) There exist other commonly used protocols (such as FIFO) and networks (such as arrays and hypercubes) that are not stable. (iii) The n-node ring is stable for all greedy routing protocols (with maximum queue-size and packet delay that is linear in n). (iv) There exists a simple distributed randomized greedy protocol that is stable for all networks and requires only polynomial queue size and polynomial delay. Our results resolve several questions posed by Borodin et al., and provide the first examples of (i) a protocol that is stable for all networks, and (ii) a protocol that is not stable for all networks."

We develop an adversarial theory of queuing aimed at addressing some of the restrictions inherent in probabilistic analysis and queuing theory based on time-invariant stochastic generation. We examine the stability of queuing networks and policies when the arrival process is adversarial, and provide some preliminary results in this direction. Our approach sheds light on various queuing policies in simple networks, and paves the way for a systematic study of queuing with few or no probabilistic assumptions.

    :abstractText: "The dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information. Gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches.In many settings, such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts, new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most \"interesting\" to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we propose distance-based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip mechanisms: a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d, and is independent of the size of the network.For nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip mechanisms, called spatial gossip, that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distance d, with high probability, in O(log1 + &epsiv; d) time steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, and deterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. [1987].We further show an application of our gossip mechanisms to a basic resource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly learn the location of the nearest copy of a resource in a network. This problem, which is of considerable practical importance, can be solved by a very simple protocol using Spatial Gossip, whereas we can show that no protocol built on top of uniform gossip can inform nodes of their approximately nearest resource within poly-logarithmic time. The analysis relies on an additional useful property of spatial gossip, namely that information travels from its source to sinks along short paths not visiting points of the network far from the two nodes."

    :abstractText: The network structure of a hyperlinked environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have effective means for understanding it. We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of context on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of &ldquo;authorative&rdquo; information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of &ldquo;hub pages&rdquo; that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis.

    :abstractText: We study a novel genre of optimization problems, which we call segmentation problems, motivated in part by certain aspects of clustering and data mining. For any classical optimization problem, the corresponding segmentation problem seeks to partition a set of cost vectors into several segments, so that the overall cost is optimized. We focus on two natural and interesting (but MAXSNP-complete) problems in this class, the hypercube segmentation problem and the catalog segmentation problem, and present approximation algorithms for them. We also present a general greedy scheme, which can be specialized to approximate any segmentation problem.

    :abstractText: Given a snapshot of a social network, can we infer which new interactions among its members are likely to occur in the near future? We formalize this question as the link-prediction problem, and we develop approaches to link prediction based on measures for analyzing the &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; of nodes in a network. Experiments on large coauthorship networks suggest that information about future interactions can be extracted from network topology alone, and that fairly subtle measures for detecting node proximity can outperform more direct measures. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    :abstractText: We consider a class of problems in which an algorithm seeks to compute a function f over a set of n inputs, where each input has an associated price. The algorithm queries inputs sequentially, trying to learn the value of the function for the minimum cost. We apply the competitive analysis of algorithms to this framework, designing algorithms that incur large cost only when the cost of the cheapest "proof" for the value of f is also large. We provide algorithms that achieve the optimal competitive ratio for functions that include arbitrary Boolean AND/OR trees, and for the problem of searching in a sorted array. We also investigate a model for pricing in this framework and construct, for every AND/OR tree, a set of prices that satisfies a very strong type of equilibrium property.

    :abstractText: "Many network problems are based on fundamental relationships involving time. Consider, for example, the problems of modeling the flow of information through a distributed network, studying the spread of a disease through a population, or analyzing the reachability properties of an airline timetable. In such settings, a natural model is that of a graph in which each edge is annotated with a time label specifying the time at which its endpoints \"communicated.\" We will call such a graph a temporal network. To model the notion that information in such a network \"flows\" only on paths whose labels respect the ordering of time, we call a path time-respecting if the time labels on its edges are non-decreasing. The central motivation for our work is the following question: how do the basic combinatorial and algorithmic properties of graphs change when we impose this additional temporal condition? The notion of a path is intrinsic to many of the most fundamental algorithmic problems on graphs; spanning trees, connectivity, flows, and cuts are some examples. When we focus on time-respecting paths in place of arbitrary paths, many of these problems acquire a character that is different from the traditional setting, but very rich in its own right. We provide results on two types of problems for temporal networks. First, we consider connectivity problems, in which we seek disjoint time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. The natural analogue of Menger's Theorem for node-disjoint paths fails in general for time-respecting paths; we give a non-trivial characterization of those graphs for which the theorem does hold in terms of an excluded subdivision theorem, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm for connectivity on this class of graphs. (The problem on general graphs is NP-complete.) We then define and study the class of inference problems, in which we seek to reconstruct a partially specified time labeling of a network in a manner consistent with an observed history of information flow."

    :abstractText: "We study the problem of auditing databases which support statistical sum queries to protect the security of sensitive information; we focus on the special case in which the sensitive information is Boolean. Principles and techniques developed for the security of statistical databases in the case of continuous attributes do not apply here. We prove certain strong complexity results suggesting that there is no general efficient solution for the auditing problem in this case. We propose two efficient algorithms: The first is applicable when the sum queries are one-dimensional range queries (we prove that the problem is NP-hard even in the two-dimensional case). The second is an approximate algorithm that maintains security, although it may be too restrictive. Finally, we consider a \"dual\" variant, with continuous data but an aggregate function that is combinatorial in nature. Specifically, we provide algorithms for two natural definitions of the auditing condition when the aggregate function is MAX."

    :abstractText: A collaborative filtering system at an e-commerce site or similar service uses data about aggregate user behavior to make recommendations tailored to specific user interests. We develop recommendation algorithms with provable performance guarantees in a probabilistic mixture model for collaborative filtering proposed by Hofmann and Puzicha. We identify certain novel parameters of mixture models that are closely connected with the best achievable performance of a recommendation algorithm; we show that for any system in which these parameters are bounded, it is possible to give recommendations whose quality converges to optimal as the amount of data grows. All our bounds depend on a new measure of independence that can be viewed as an L"1-analogue of the smallest singular value of a matrix. Using this, we introduce a technique based on generalized pseudoinverse matrices and linear programming for handling sets of high-dimensional vectors. We also show that standard approaches based on L"2 spectral methods are not strong enough to yield comparable results, thereby suggesting some inherent limitations of spectral analysis.

    :abstractText: A number of basic models for VLSI layout are based on the construction of node-disjoint paths between terminals on a multilayer grid. In this setting, one is interested in minimizing both the number of layers required and the area of the underlying grid. Building on work of Cutler and Shiloach [ Networks, 8 (1978), pp. 253--278], Aggarwal et al. [ Proc. 26th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science , Portland, OR, 1985; Algorithmica, 6 (1991), pp. 241--255], and Aggarwal, Klawe, and Shor [ Algorithmica}, 6 (1991), pp. 129--151], we prove an upper-bound trade-off between these two quantities in a general multilayer grid model. As a special case of our main result, we obtain significantly improved bounds for the problem of routing a full permutation on the mesh using node-disjoint paths; our new bound here is within polylogarithmic factors of the bisection bound. Our algorithms involve some new techniques for analyzing the structure of node-disjoint paths in planar graphs and indicate some respects in which this problem, at least in the planar case, is fundamentally different from its edge-disjoint counterpart.

    :abstractText: In many optimization problems, one seeks to allocate a limited set of resources to a set of individuals with demands. Thus, such allocations can naturally be viewed as vectors, with one coordinate representing each individual. Motivated by work in network routing and bandwidth assignment, we consider the problem of producing solutions that simultaneously approximate all feasible allocations in a coordinate-wise sense. This is a very strong type of &ldquo;global&rdquo; approximation guarantee, and we explore its consequences in a wide range of discrete optimization problems, including facility location, scheduling, and bandwidth assignment in networks. A fundamental issue&mdash;one not encountered in the traditional design of approximation algorithms&mdash;is that good approximations in this global sense need not exist for every problem instance; there is no a priori reason why there should be an allocation that simultaneously approximates all others. As a result, the existential questions concerning such good allocations lead to a new perspective on a number of fundamental problems in resource allocation, and on the structure of their feasible solutions.

    :abstractText: An important problem in VLSI design is distributing a clock signal to synchronous elements in a VLSI circuit so that the signal arrives at all elements simultaneously. The signal is distributed by means of a clock routing tree rooted at a global clock source. The difference in length between the longest and shortest root-leaf path is called the skew of the tree. The problem is to construct a clock tree with zero skew (to achieve synchronicity) and minimal sum of edge lengths (so that circuit area and clock tree capacitance are minimized).We give the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for this problem and its variants that arise in the VLSI context. For the zero skew problem in general metric spaces, we give an approximation algorithm with a performance guarantee of 2e. For the L1 version on the plane, we give an (8/ln 2)-approximation algorithm.

    :abstractText: "Local search is widely used for solving the propositional satisfiability problem. Papadimitriou (1991) showed that randomized local search solves 2-SAT in polynomial time. Recently, Sch\xC3\xB6ning (1999) proved that a close algorithm for k-SAT takes time (2 - 2/k)n up to a polynomial factor. This is the best known worst-case upper bound for randomized 3-SAT algorithms (cf. also recent preprint by Schuler et al.).We describe a deterministic local search algorithm for k-SAT running in time (2-2/(k+ 1))n up to a polynomial factor. The key point of our algorithm is the use of covering codes instead of random choice of initial assignments. Compared to other \"weakly exponential\" algorithms, our algorithm is technically quite simple. We also describe an improved version of local search. For 3-SAT the improved algorithm runs in time 1.481n up to a polynomial factor. Our bounds are better than all previous bounds for deterministic k-SAT algorithms."

    :abstractText: We describe a novel approach for clustering collections of sets, and its application to the analysis and mining of categorical data. By &ldquo;categorical data,&rdquo; we mean tables with fields that cannot be naturally ordered by a metric &ndash; e.g., the names of producers of automobiles, or the names of products offered by a manufacturer. Our approach is based on an iterative method for assigning and propagating weights on the categorical values in a table; this facilitates a type of similarity measure arising from the co-occurrence of values in the dataset. Our techniques can be studied analytically in terms of certain types of non-linear dynamical systems.

    :abstractText: Website traffic varies through time in consistent and predictable ways, with highest traffic in the middle of the day. When providing media content to visitors, it is important to present repeat visitors with new content so that they keep coming back. In this paper we present an algorithm to balance the need to keep a website fresh with new content with the desire to present the best content to the most visitors at times of peak traffic. We formulate this as the media scheduling problem, where we attempt to maximize total clicks, given the overall traffic pattern and the time varying clickthrough rates of available media content. We present an efficient algorithm to perform this scheduling under certain conditions and apply this algorithm to real data obtained from server logs, showing evidence of significant improvements in traffic from our algorithmic schedules. Finally, we analyze the click data, presenting models for why and how the clickthrough rate for new content declines as it ages.

    :abstractText: "There are many on-line settings in which users publicly express opinions. A number of these offer mechanisms for other users to evaluate these opinions; a canonical example is Amazon.com, where reviews come with annotations like \"26 of 32 people found the following review helpful.\" Opinion evaluation appears in many off-line settings as well, including market research and political campaigns. Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is fundamentally different from reasoning about the opinion itself: rather than asking, \"What did Y think of X?\", we are asking, \"What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?\" Here we develop a framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a large-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We find that the perceived helpfulness of a review depends not just on its content but also but also in subtle ways on how the expressed evaluation relates to other evaluations of the same product. As part of our approach, we develop novel methods that take advantage of the phenomenon of review \"plagiarism\" to control for the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we provide a simple and natural mathematical model consistent with our findings. Our analysis also allows us to distinguish among the predictions of competing theories from sociology and social psychology, and to discover unexpected differences in the collective opinion-evaluation behavior of user populations from ifferent countries."

    :abstractText: "Concurrent with recent theoretical interest in the problem of metric embedding, a growing body of research in the networking community has studied the distance matrix defined by node-to-node latencies in the Internet, resulting in a number of recent approaches that approximately embed this distance matrix into low-dimensional Euclidean space. There is a fundamental distinction, however, between the theoretical approaches to the embedding problem and this recent Internet-related work: in addition to computational limitations, Internet measurement algorithms operate under the constraint that it is only feasible to measure distances for a linear (or near-linear) number of node pairs, and typically in a highly structured way. Indeed, the most common framework for Internet measurements of this type is a beacon-based approach one chooses uniformly at random a constant number of nodes (&ldquo;beacons&rdquo;) in the network, each node measures its distance to all beacons, and one then has access to only these measurements for the remainder of the algorithm. Moreover, beacon-based algorithms are often designed not for embedding but for the more basic problem of triangulation, in which one uses the triangle inequality to infer the distances that have not been measured. Here we give algorithms with provable performance guarantees for beacon-based triangulation and embedding. We show that in addition to multiplicative error in the distances, performance guarantees for beacon-based algorithms typically must include a notion of slack&mdash;a certain fraction of all distances may be arbitrarily distorted. For metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension (which have been proposed as a reasonable abstraction of Internet latencies), we show that triangulation-based distance reconstruction with a constant number of beacons can achieve multiplicative error 1 + &delta; on a 1 &minus; &epsi; fraction of distances, for arbitrarily small constants &delta; and &epsi;. For this same class of metric spaces, we give a beacon-based embedding algorithm that achieves constant distortion on a 1 &minus; &epsi; fraction of distances; this provides some theoretical justification for the success of the recent Global Network Positioning algorithm of Ng and Zhang [2002], and it forms an interesting contrast with lower bounds showing that it is not possible to embed all distances in a doubling metric space with constant distortion. We also give results for other classes of metric spaces, as well as distributed algorithms that require only a sparse set of distances but do not place too much measurement load on any one node."

    :abstractText: In keeping with an annual tradition, this issue of the SIAM Journal on Computing contains extended versions of selected papers from the Thirty-Eighth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2006), which was held May 21-23, 2006, in Seattle, Washington. The conference program included 78 papers selected by a program committee consisting of Scott Aaronson, Eli Ben-Sasson, Allan Borodin, David Eppstein, Sudipto Guha, Piotr Indyk, Jon Kleinberg, Tal Malkin, Frank McSherry, Dieter van Melkebeek, Michael Mitzenmacher, Assaf Naor, Rafail Ostrovsky, Toniann Pitassi, R. Ravi, Dana Ron, Amin Saberi, Amit Sahai, Rocco Servedio, and Madhu Sudan. Preliminary versions of these papers appeared in the conference proceedings published by ACM Press. This special issue contains 11 of these papers; the authors were invited by the program committee to prepare extended versions of their papers, which were then refereed according to the journal's high standards. In the process, these papers were considerably revised and expanded. Collectively, they represent some of the recent highlights from a broad cross-section of active areas within theoretical computer science, including randomness in computation, approximation algorithms and inapproximability, proof complexity, property testing, constraint satisfaction, quantum computing, algorithmic game theory, and high-dimensional geometric algorithms. In total, the six of us listed below handled the editing of these papers. We would like to thank all of the referees and the full program committee for their contributions to the preparation of this special issue.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose a protocol for load sharing among a cluster of heterogeneous Unix workstations. Our protocol, called the Distributed Process Management Protocol (DPMP), not only enables load sharing using non-preemptive process migration but also seamlessly integrates the processes running on a network of machines. Remote processes can be accessed (for signalling, for example), in the same way as local processes making process migration highly transparent to the users and the applications. DPM-P also has builtin mechanisms to detect and recover from node and network failures. DPMP can be implemented at either the kernel or the user level. We also describe an implementation of DPMP within the Linux kernel. Preliminary performance studies show that the performance gains obtained by using DPMP are substantial.

    :abstractText: Resource borrowing is a common underlying approach in grid computing and thin-client computing. In both cases, external processes borrow resources that would otherwise be delivered to the interactive processes of end-users, creating contention that slows these processes and decreases the comfort of the end-users. How resource borrowing and user comfort are related is not well understood and thus resource borrowing tends to be extremely conservative. To address this lack of understanding, we have developed a sophisticated distributed application for directly measuring user comfort with the borrowing of CPU time, memory space, and disk bandwidth. Using this tool, we have conducted a controlled user study with qualitative and quantitative results that are of direct interest to the designers of grid and thin-client systems. We have found that resource borrowing can be quite aggressive without creating user discomfort, particularly in the case of memory and disk. We also describe an on-going Internet-wide study using our tool.

    :abstractText: We propose a data model and a few algebraic operations that provide semantic foundation to multidimensional databases. The distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the symmetric treatment not only of all dimensions but also measures. The model provides support for multiple hierarchies along each dimension and support for adhoc aggregates. The proposed operators are composable, reorderable, and closed in application. These operators are also minimal in the sense that none can be expressed in terms of others nor can any one be dropped without sacrificing functionality. They make possible the declarative specification and optimization of multidimensional database queries that are currently specified operationally. The operators have been designed to be translated to SQL and can be implemented either on top of a relational database system or within a special purpose multidimensional database engine. In effect, they provide an algebraic application programming interface (API) that allows the separation of the frontend from the backend. Finally, the proposed model provides a framework in which to study multidimensional databases and opens several new research problems.

    :abstractText: Cognitive psychologists have long recognized that the acquisition of a motor skill involves a transition from attention-demanding controlled processing to more fluent automatic processing. Neuroscientific studies suggest that controlled and automatic processing rely on two largely distinct neural pathways. The controlled pathway, which includes the prefrontal cortex, is seen as acquiring declarative representations of skills. In comparison, the automatic pathway is thought to develop procedural representations. Automaticity in motor skill learning involves a reduction in dependence on frontal systems and an increased reliance on the automatic pathway. In this paper, we propose a biologically plausible computational model of motor skill automaticity. This model offers a dual-pathway neurocomputational account of the translation of declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge during motor learning. In support of the model, we review some previously reported human experimental results involving the learning of a sequential key pressing task, and we demonstrate, through simulation, howthe model provides a parsimonious explanation for these results.

    :abstractText: Traffic anomalies such as failures and attacks are increasing in frequency and severity, and thus identifying them rapidly and accurately is critical for large network operators. The detection typically treats the traffic as a collection of flows and looks for heavy changes in traffic patterns (<i>e.g.</i>, volume, number of connections). However, as link speeds and the number of flows increase, keeping per-flow state is not scalable. The recently proposed sketch-based schemes [14] are among the very few that can detect heavy changes and anomalies over massive data streams at network traffic speeds. However, sketches do not preserve the key (<i>e.g.</i>, source IP address) of the flows. Hence, even if anomalies are detected, it is difficult to infer the culprit flows, making it a big practical hurdle for online deployment. Meanwhile, the number of keys is too large to record. To address this challenge, we propose efficient <i>reversible hashing</i> algorithms to infer the keys of culprit flows from sketches without storing any explicit key information. No extra memory or memory accesses are needed for recording the streaming data. Meanwhile, the heavy change detection daemon runs in the background with space complexity and computational time sublinear to the key space size. This short paper describes the conceptual framework of the reversible sketches, as well as some initial approaches for implementation. See [23] for the optimized algorithms in details. comment We further apply various emph IP-mangling algorithms and emph bucket classification methods to reduce the false positives and false negatives. Evaluated with netflow traffic traces of a large edge router, we demonstrate that the reverse hashing can quickly infer the keys of culprit flows even for many changes with high accuracy.

We present, an intensive experimental study on wireless Link Quality Indicator (LQI). Using Moteiv's Tmote Sky sensors, we deployed multiHopLQI algorithm of TinyOS in various network configurations: homogeneous and heterogeneous; straight-line and grid topologies with various transmission power levels and distances.Initially, we study LQI time-varying and try to understand the relationship between transmission power level, distance and link quality and present how some random disturbances due to external (physical changes) or internal phenomena (node movement,power variation) may affect the dynamics of the network. Later, we address impacts and side effects of position and power transmission level of some important nodes in the network like the Base Station in such LQI based algorithms."

    :abstractText: Users today are struggling to integrate a broad range of information sources providing different levels of query capabilities. Currently, data sources with different and limited capabilities are accessed either by writing rich functional wrappers for the more primitive souces, or by dealing with all sources at a &ldquo;lowest common denominator&rdquo;. This paper explores a third approach, in which a mediator ensures that sources receive queries they can handle, while still taking avantage of all of the query power of the source. We propose an architecture that enables this, and identify a key component of that architecture, the Capabilities-Based Rewriter (CBR). The CBR takes as input a description of the capabilities of a data source, and a query targeted for that data source. From these, the CBR determines component queries to be sent to the sources, commensurate with their abilities, and computes a plan for combining their results using joins, unions, selections, and projections. We provide a language to describe the query capability of data sources and a plan generation algorithm are schema idependent and handle SPJ queries.

    :abstractText: A data warehouse stores materialized views over data from one or more sources in order to provide fast access to the integrated data, regardless of the availability of the data sources. Warehouse views need to be maintained in response to changes to the base data in the sources. Except for very simple views, maintaining a warehouse view requires access to data that is not available in the view itself. Hence, to maintain the view, one either has to query the data sources or store auxiliary data in the warehouse. We show that by using key and referential integrity constraints, we often can maintain a select-project-join view without going to the data sources or replicating the base relations in their entirety in the warehouse. We derive a set of auxiliary views together are self-maintainable&mdash;they can be maintained without going to the data sources or replicating all base data. In addition, our technique can be applied to simplify traditional materialized view maintenance by exploiting key and referential integrity constraints.

    :abstractText: A nonrecursive system is any database system whose query language does not support recursive queries. Thus, many existing commerical SQL database systems are nonrecursive systems. Query optimization is an important issue for nonrecursive queries, and the magic-sets transformation has been shown to improve the performance of nonrecursive queries by many orders of magnitude [MFPR90]. It is thus important to use the magic-sets transformation in nonrecursive systems. However, there is a problem. The magic-sets optimization can transform a nonrecursive query into a recursive query. Since a recursive query cannot be executed by a nonrecursive system, such a transformation is fatal. The magic-sets transformation cannot therefore be used in nonrecursive systems. In this paper we present algorithms that achieve the optimization of the magic-sets transformation while guaranteeing that the transformed program will be nonrecursive whenever the original program is nonrecursive. The algorithms can be extended to the supplementary magic-sets transformation. We also define a new optimization technique for recursive and nonrecursive queries, covered subgoal elimination, that can eliminate subgoals from a rule, and can sometimes convert a recursive query into a nonrecursive one. The algorithms presented in this paper are of practical relevance since they make it possible to incorporate the magic-sets transformation into existing commercial database systems.

However, efficient implementation of constraint checking is difficult. In this paper we explore techniques for assuring constraint satisfaction without performing a complete evaluation of the constraints. We consider methods that use only constraint definitions, methods that use constraints and updates, and methods that use constraints, updates, and &ldquo;local&rdquo; data.

    :abstractText: "We consider a variant of the view maintenance problem: How does one keep a materialized view up-to-date when the view definition itself changes? Can one do better than recomputing the view from the base relations? Traditional view maintenance tries to maintain the materialized view in response to modifications to the base relations; we try to \"adapt\" the view in response to changes in the view definition.Such techniques are needed for applications where the user can change queries dynamically and see the changes in the results fast. Data archaeology, data visualization, and dynamic queries are examples of such applications.We consider all possible redefinitions of SQL SELECT-FROM-WHERE-GROUPBY, UNION, and EXCEPT views, and show how these views can be adapted using the old materialization for the cases where it is possible to do so. We identify extra information that can be kept with a materialization to facilitate redefinition. Multiple simultaneous changes to a view can be handled without necessarily materializing intermediate results. We identify guidelines for users and database administrators that can be used to facilitate efficient view adaptation."

The view definitions can be in SQL or Datalog, and may use UNION, negation, aggregation (e.g. SUM, MIN), linear recursion, and general recursion. We first present a counting algorithm that tracks the number of alternative derivations (counts) for each derived tuple in a view. The algorithm works with both set and duplicate semantics. We present the algorithm for nonrecursive views (with negation and aggregation), and show that the count for a tuple can be computed at little or no cost above the cost of deriving the tuple. The algorithm is optimal in that it computes exactly those view tuples that are inserted or deleted. Note that we store only the number of derivations, not the derivations themselves. We then present the Delete and Rederive algorithm, DRed, for incremental maintenance of recursive views (negation and aggregation are permitted). The algorithm works by first deleting a superset of the tuples that need to be deleted, and then rederiving some of them. The algorithm can also be used when the view definition is itself altered.

    :abstractText: We present an optimization for integrity constraint verification in distributed databases. The optimization allows a global constraint, i.e. a constraint spanning multiple databases, to be verified by accessing data at a single database, eliminating the cost of accessing remote data. The optimization is based on an algorithm that takes as input a global constraint and data to be inserted into a local database. The algorithm produces a local condition such that if the local data satisfies this condition then, based on the previous satisfaction of the global constraint, the global constraint is still satisfied. If the local data does not satisfy the condition, then a conventional global verification procedure is required.

    :abstractText: The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to add origin authentication and integrity. DNSSEC defined a public key infrastructure over DNS tree hierarchy for the public key validation. In DNSSEC, a parent zone authenticates public keys of its child zones. The authentication hierarchy is broken when a parent does not support DNSSEC. This paper proposes an effective mechanism to overcome this partial deployment problem. Our solution uses a public bulletin board for zones to post their DNSKEY information. Resolvers use posted key information to find key authentication chains that can be used to validate the DNSKEY. Bulletin Board(BB) provides complete trust relationship information when the key authentication hierarchy is broken, and distributes the complete key information even when false zones provide the invalid keys. The bulletin board does not guarantee the correctness of DNSKEY information, but it does guarantee the completeness of the key information. Our approach helps DNS zones to deploy DNSSEC even when their parent zones do not deploy DNSSEC, and it does not require any changes to the current DNSSEC protocol and the existing software.

    :abstractText: Experimental computer systems research typically ignores the end-user, modeling him, if at all, in overly simple ways. We argue that this (1) results in inadequate performance evaluation of the systems, and (2) ignores opportunities. We summarize our experiences with (a) directly evaluating user satisfaction and (b) incorporating user feedback in different areas of client/server computing, and use our experiences to motivate principles for that domain. Specifically, we report on user studies to measure user satisfaction with resource borrowing and with different clock frequencies in desktop computing, the development and evaluation of user interfaces to integrate user feedback into scheduling and clock frequency decisions in this context, and results in predicting user action and system response in a remote display system. We also present initial results on extending our work to user control of scheduling and mapping of virtual machines in a virtualization-based distributed computing environment. We then generalize (a) and (b) as recommendations for incorporating the user into experimental computer systems research.

    :abstractText: Users today are struggling to integrate a broad range of information sources providing different levels of query capabilities. Currently, data sources with different and limited capabilities are accessed either by writing rich functional wrappers for the more primitive sources, or by dealing with all sources at a &ldquo;lowest common denominator&rdquo;. This paper explores a third approach, in which a mediator ensures that sources receive queries they can handle, while still taking advantage of all of the query power of the source. We propose an architecture that enables this, and identify a key component of that architecture, the Capabilities-Based Rewriter (CBR). The CBR takes as input a description of the capabilities of a data source, and a query targeted for that data source. From these, the CBR determines component queries to be sent to the sources, commensurate with their abilities, and computes a plan for combining their results using joins, unions, selections, and projections. We provide a language to describe the query capability of data sources and a plan generation algorithm. Our description language and plan generation algorithm are schema independent and handle SPJ queries. We also extend CBR with a cost-based optimizer. The net effect is that we prune without losing completeness. Finally we compare the implementation of a CBR for the Garlic project with the algorithms proposed in this paper.

    :abstractText: Most e-commerce web sites are very large, often confusing and overwhelm the visitor with a huge amount of information. People cannot easily find what they are looking for. Moreover, the web site is presented in the same format to every visitor, irrespective of his needs. This paper proposes a model to solve the above problems. Our model divides the visitors into groups. Then it arranges web pages in the decreasing order of preference for each group and applies path prediction to find sink pages for that group. The results of these algorithms are displayed in a separate frame without modifying the site. Secondly, our paper addresses the need to guide visitors during the configuration of a product. We propose to apply data mining on the quotes for every group and find associations between different components of the product. We can then display these results as suggestions while the prospective buyer is configuring the product. These suggestions will dynamically change as each selection is made. We have discussed the data mining algorithms applicable to our model.

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of evaluating a large number of XPath expressions on a stream of XML packets. We contribute two novel techniques. The first is to use a single Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The contribution here is to show that the DFA can be used effectively for this problem: in our experiments we achieve a constant throughput, independently of the number of XPath expressions. The major issue is the size of the DFA, which, in theory, can be exponential in the number of XPath expressions. We provide a series of theoretical results and experimental evaluations that show that the lazy DFA has a small number of states, for all practical purposes. These results are of general interest in XPath processing, beyond stream processing. The second technique is the Streaming IndeX (SIX), which consists of adding a small amount of binary data to each XML packet that allows the query processor to achieve significant speedups. As an application of these techniques we describe the XML Toolkit (XMLTK), a collection of command-line tools providing highly scalable XML data processing."

    :abstractText: A key function for network traffic monitoring and analysis is the ability to perform aggregate queries over multiple data streams. Change detection is an important primitive which can be extended to construct many aggregate queries. The recently proposed sketches are among the very few that can detect heavy changes online for high speed links, and thus support various aggregate queries in both temporal and spatial domains. However, it does not preserve the keys (e. g., source IP address) of flows, making it difficult to reconstruct the desired set of anomalous keys. To address this challenge, we propose the reversible sketch data structure along with reverse hashing algorithms to infer the keys of culprit flows. There are two phases. The first operates online, recording the packet stream in a compact representation with negligible extra memory and few extra memory accesses. Our prototype single FPGA board implementation can achieve a throughput of over 16 Gb/s for 40-byte packet streams (the worst case). The second phase identifies heavy changes and their keys from the representation in nearly real time. We evaluate our scheme using traces from large edge routers with OC-12 or higher links. Both the analytical and experimental results show that we are able to achieve online traffic monitoring and accurate change/intrusion detection over massive data streams on high speed links, all in a manner that scales to large key space size. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first to achieve these properties simultaneously.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose two database updating models for homogeneous and auto configurable sensor network deployed in a truck without base station. In the first model, a Virtual Base Station (VBS) is periodically elected to act as classical base station for a given period of time. VBS election algorithm is based on the remaining energy level of each node at the time of selection of the VBS. The second idea deals with Energy aware Wait and See (WaS) protocol which manages update requests to avoid collisions. Like VBS, this protocol is also based on energy. Simulation results show that VBS and WaS models introduce very low overhead with respect to the classical network with permanent base station.

    :abstractText: Virtual machine distributed computing greatly simplifies the use of widespread computing resources by lowering the level of abstraction, benefiting both resource providers and users. Towards that end our Virtuoso middleware closely emulates the existing process of buying, configuring and using physical machines. Virtuoso's VNET component is a simple and efficient layer two virtual network tool that makes these virtual machines (VMs) appear to be physically connected to the home network of the user while simultaneously supporting arbitrary topologies and routing among them. Virtuoso's VTTIF component continually infers the communication behavior of the application running in a collection of VMs. The combination of overlays like VNET and inference frameworks like VTTIF has great potential to increase the performance, with no user or developer involvement, of existing, unmodified applications by adapting their virtual environments to the underlying computing infrastructure to best suit the applications. We show here how to use the continually inferred application topology and traffic to dynamically control three mechanisms of adaptation, VM migration, overlay topology, and forwarding to significantly increase the performance of two classes of applications, bulk synchronous parallel applications and transactional Web e-commerce applications.

    :abstractText: An online hotlink assignment algorithm is proposed for designing adaptive websites. The objective is to reach desired pages on a website in minimum number of clicks, thereby reducing the load on the web server. As a consequence, the traffic on the internet is also reduced. The hotlinks are assigned based on the frequency of access of pages. We model a website as a single source directed graph. Optimal hotlink assignment problem is NP-hard for general graphs. The website graph is reduced to a Breadth First Search (BFS) tree which maintains the semantic relationships between web pages. The proposed online algorithm can place at most k hotlinks per page with a maximum of l hotlinks on the entire website, where k&laquo;l. The input stream is simulated using the Zipf distribution. The results presented in the paper compare the performance of the online algorithm with the optimal offline algorithm.

    :abstractText: "The Intel Mote is a new sensor node platform motivated by several design goals: increased CPU performance, improved radio bandwidth and reliability and the usage of commercial off-the-shelf components in order to maintain cost-effectiveness. This new platform is built around an integrated wireless microcontroller consisting of an ARM*7 core, a Bluetooth* radio, RAM and FLASH memory as well as various I/O options. Due to the connection-oriented nature of Bluetooth, a new network formation and maintenance algorithms that are optimized for this protocol have been created. In particular, the \"scatternet\" mode of Bluetooth has been successfully adapted to form networks comprised of multiple piconet. The Intel Mote software architecture is based on an ARM port of TinyOS. Networking and routing layers have been created on top of the TinyOS base to provide the underlying multi-hop functionality. The network is self-organizing on startup and has mechanisms to repair failed links and circumvent failed nodes. Lower level functionality has been abstracted in the higher-level interface to allow the application programmer to utilize a virtual mesh network view without having to manage details of the Bluetooth operation. A new transport protocol has been developed to support end to end reliable transmission of large datagrams between arbitrary nodes in the network. Leveraging the Bluetooth hold mode, a network low power mode has been implemented. During this mode, data can still flow through the network at very lower rates, reducing the power consumption, while maintaining a fast network response time. The Intel Mote was deployed in a pilot equipment monitoring application using industrial vibration sensors. This application was chosen since it benefits from the increased platform capabilities and network bandwidth of the Intel Mote platform. It also represents a potentially large market in the industrial monitoring and controls sector."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we extend the Hilbert space embedding approach to handle conditional distributions. We derive a kernel estimate for the conditional embedding, and show its connection to ordinary embeddings. Conditional embeddings largely extend our ability to manipulate distributions in Hilbert spaces, and as an example, we derive a nonparametric method for modeling dynamical systems where the belief state of the system is maintained as a conditional embedding. Our method is very general in terms of both the domains and the types of distributions that it can handle, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various dynamical systems. We expect that conditional embeddings will have wider applications beyond modeling dynamical systems.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present a visual hull embossment algorithm which works on the base of a visual hull to reconstruct a precise model from calibrated color images. The algorithm uses the geometry of the visual hull to compute voxel normals and visibilities. Then a photometric consistency field (PCF) is computed, which describes the photometric consistency score of every voxel. The visual hull is refined in a view dependent fashion. For each view, we compute a view dependent PCF (VDPCF) by resampling the PCF and then find an optimal depth image in VDPCF with graph cut based energy minimization, which takes into consideration data, smoothness and adjustment terms simultaneously. The depth images are used for carving voxels. Our algorithm can produce precise models with a moderate speed

    :abstractText: The credibility of web sites is becoming an increasingly important area to understand. To expand knowledge in this domain, we conducted an online study that investigated how different elements of Web sites affect people's perception of credibility. Over 1400 people participated in this study, both from the U.S. and Europe, evaluating 51 different Web site elements. The data showed which elements boost and which elements hurt perceptions of Web credibility. Through analysis we found these elements fell into one of seven factors. In order of impact, the five types of elements that increased credibility perceptions were &ldquo;real-world feel&rdquo;, &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo;, &ldquo;expertise&rdquo;, &ldquo;trustworthiness&rdquo;, and &ldquo;tailoring&rdquo;. The two types of elements that hurt credibility were &ldquo;commercial implications&rdquo ;and &ldquo;amateurism&rdquo;. This large-scale study lays the groundwork for further research into the elements that affect Web credibility. The results also suggest implications for designing credible Web sites.

This simple technique gives people information about their daily lives, is easily accessible to many at no extra cost, requires little setup, and does not require the manufacture of any external devices. We will focus on how financial data can be used to show users where they spend their time, when they accomplish certain habits, and what the impact of their activities is on the environment. We validate our idea by implementing three demonstration applications intended for personal use. Finally, this paper discusses limitations of sensing using financial data and possible solutions.

    :abstractText: Sensor network systems attempt to exploit redundancy which is assumed to be inherent in a pervasive sensor network due to the density of the sensor nodes. However, there is a lack of sensor data stream correlation between seemingly redundant sensors. The approach presented the uses and prediction techniques that have been used to anticipate a sensor value using its own history, to allow one sensor to be able to anticipate the data from another different sensor, given a historical stream of data from the sensor to be anticipated. The specific mechanisms explored are artificial neural networks, pattern recognition and multivariate polynomial regression.

    :abstractText: We address the problem of designing practical, energy-efficient protocols for data collection in wireless sensor networks using predictive modeling. Prior work has suggested several approaches to capture and exploit the rich spatio-temporal correlations prevalent in WSNs during data collection. Although shown to be effective in reducing the data collection cost, those approaches use simplistic corelation models and further, ignore many idiosyncrasies of WSNs, in particular the broadcast nature of communication. Our proposed approach is based on approximating the joint probability distribution over the sensors using undirected graphical models, ideally suited to exploit both the spatial correlations and the broadcast nature of communication. We present algorithms for optimally using such a model for data collection under different communication models, and for identifying an appropriate model to use for a given sensor network. Experiments over synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly reduces the data collection cost.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we address the problem of extending a relational database system to facilitate efficient real-time application of dynamic probabilistic models to streaming data. We use the recently proposed abstraction of model-based views for this purpose, by allowing users to declaratively specify the model to be applied, and by presenting the output of the models to the user as a probabilistic database view. We support declarative querying over such views using an extended version of SQL that allows for querying probabilistic data. Underneath we use particle filters, a class of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, to represent the present and historical states of the model as sets of weighted samples (particles) that are kept up-to-date as new data arrives. We develop novel techniques to convert the queries on the model-based view directly into queries over particle tables, enabling highly efficient query processing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation over several synthetic and real datasets, that demonstrates the feasibility of online modeling of streaming data using our system and establishes the advantages of tight integration between dynamic probabilistic models and databases.

    :abstractText: We address the problem of minimizing the response time of a multi-way join query using pipelined (inter-operator) parallelism, in a parallel or a distributed environment. We observe that in order to fully exploit the parallelism in the system, we must consider a new class of "interleaving" plans, where multiple query plans are used simultaneously to minimize the response time of a query (or to maximize the tuple-throughput of the system). We cast the query planning problem in this environment as a "flow maximization problem", and present polynomial-time algorithms that (statically) find the optimal set of plans to use for a given query, for a large class of multi-way join queries. Our proposed algorithms also naturally extend to query optimization over web services. Finally we present an extensive experimental evaluation that demonstrates both the need to consider such plans in parallel query processing and the effectiveness of our algorithms.

    :abstractText: We introduce join scheduling algorithms that employ a balanced network utilization metric to optimize the use of all network paths in a global-scale database federation. This metric allows algorithms to exploit excess capacity in the network, while avoiding narrow, long-haul paths. We give a two-approximate, polynomial-time algorithm for serial (left-deep) join schedules. We also present extensions to this algorithm that explore parallel schedules, reduce resource usage, and define trade-offs between computation and network utilization. We evaluate these techniques within the SkyQuery federation of Astronomy databases using spatial-join queries submitted by SkyQuery's users. Experiments show that our algorithms realize near-optimal network utilization with minor computational overhead.

    :abstractText: Increasing prevalence of large-scale distributed monitoring and computing environments such as sensor networks, scientific federations, Grids etc., has led to a renewed interest in the area of distributed query processing and optimization. In this paper we address a general, distributed multi-query processing problem motivated by the need to minimize the communication cost in these environments. Specifically we address the problem of optimally sharing data movement across the communication edges in a distributed communication network given a set of overlapping queries and query plans for them (specifying the operations to be executed). Most of the problem variations of our general problem can be shown to be NP-Hard by a reduction from the Steiner tree problem. However, we show that the problem can be solved optimally if the communication network is a tree, and present a novel algorithm for finding an optimal data movement plan. For general communication networks, we present efficient approximation algorithms for several variations of the problem. Finally, we present an experimental study over synthetic datasets showing both the need for exploiting the sharing of data movement and the effectiveness of our algorithms at finding such plans.

    :abstractText: There has been a recent surge in work in probabilistic databases, propelled in large part by the huge increase in noisy data sources -- sensor data, experimental data, data from uncurated sources, and many others. There is a grow- ing need to be able to flexibly represent the uncertainties in the data, and to efficiently query the data. Building on existing probabilistic database work, we present a unifying framework which allows a flexible representation of corre- lated tuple and attribute level uncertainties. An important capability of our representation is the ability to represent shared correlation structures in the data. We provide moti- vating examples to illustrate when such shared correlation structures are likely to exist. Representing shared corre- lations structures allows the use of sophisticated inference techniques based on lifted probabilistic inference that, in turn, allows us to achieve significant speedups while com- puting probabilities for results of user-submitted queries.

    :abstractText: "In this paper we study a set of problems related to efficient energy management for monitoring applications in wireless sensor networks. We study several generalizations of a basic problem called Set k-Cover, which can be described as follows: we are given a set of sensors, and a set of regions to be monitored. Each region can be monitored by a subset of the sensors. To increase the lifetime of the sensor network, we would like to partition the sensors into k sets (or time-slots) and activate each partition in a different time-slot. The goal is to find the partitioning that maximizes the coverage of the regions. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We first develop improved approximation algorithms for this problem based on its similarities to the max k-cut problem. We then consider a variation, called Set (k, \xCE\xB1)-cover, where each sensor is allowed to be active in \xCE\xB1 different time-slots. We develop a randomized routing algorithm for this problem. We then consider extensions where each sensor can monitor only a bounded number of regions in any time-slot. We develop the first approximation algorithms for this problem. An experimental evaluation of the algorithms we propose can be found in the full version of the paper."

    :abstractText: Approximating the joint data distribution of a multi-dimensional data set through a compact and accurate histogram synopsis is a fundamental problem arising in numerous practical scenarios, including query optimization and approximate query answering. Existing solutions either rely on simplistic independence assumptions or try to directly approximate the full joint data distribution over the complete set of attributes. Unfortunately, both approaches are doomed to fail for high-dimensional data sets with complex correlation patterns between attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to histogram-based synopses that employs the solid foundation of statistical interaction models to explicitly identify and exploit the statistical characteristics of the data. Abstractly, our key idea is to break the synopsis into (1) a statistical interaction model that accurately captures significant correlation and independence patterns in data, and (2) a collection of histograms on low-dimensional marginals that, based on the model, can provide accurate approximations of the overall joint data distribution. Extensive experimental results with several real-life data sets verify the effectiveness of our approach. An important aspect of our general, model-based methodology is that it can be used to enhance the performance of other synopsis techniques that are based on data-space partitioning (e.g., wavelets) by providing an effective tool to deal with the &ldquo;dimensionality curse&rdquo;.

    :abstractText: Real-world data --- especially when generated by distributed measurement infrastructures such as sensor networks --- tends to be incomplete, imprecise, and erroneous, making it impossible to present it to users or feed it directly into applications. The traditional approach to dealing with this problem is to first process the data using statistical or probabilistic models that can provide more robust interpretations of the data. Current database systems, however, do not provide adequate support for applying models to such data, especially when those models need to be frequently updated as new data arrives in the system. Hence, most scientists and engineers who depend on models for managing their data do not use database systems for archival or querying at all; at best, databases serve as a persistent raw data store.In this paper we define a new abstraction called model-based views and present the architecture of MauveDB, the system we are building to support such views. Just as traditional database views provide logical data independence, model-based views provide independence from the details of the underlying data generating mechanism and hide the irregularities of the data by using models to present a consistent view to the users. MauveDB supports a declarative language for defining model-based views, allows declarative querying over such views using SQL, and supports several different materialization strategies and techniques to efficiently maintain them in the face of frequent updates. We have implemented a prototype system that currently supports views based on regression and interpolation, using the Apache Derby open source DBMS, and we present results that show the utility and performance benefits that can be obtained by supporting several different types of model-based views in a database system.

    :abstractText: Probabilistic graphical models provide a framework for compact representation and efficient reasoning about the joint probability distribution of several interdependent variables. This is a classical topic with roots in statistical physics. In recent years, spurred by several applications in unstructured data integration, sensor networks, image processing, bio-informatics, and code design, the topic has received renewed interest in the machine learning, data mining, and database communities. Techniques from graphical models have also been applied to many topics directly of interest to the database community including information extraction, sensor data analysis, imprecise data representation and querying, selectivity estimation for query optimization, and data privacy. As database research continues to expand beyond the confines of traditional enterprise domains, we expect both the need and applicability of probabilistic graphical models to increase dramatically over the next few years. With this tutorial, we are aiming to provide a foundational overview of probabilistic graphical models to the database community, accompanied by a brief overview of some of the recent research literature on the role of graphical models in databases.

    :abstractText: Vehicle tracking has a wide variety of applications from law enforcement to traffic planning and public safety. However, the image resolution of the videos available from most traffic camera systems, make it difficult to track vehicles based on unique identifiers like license plates. In many cases, vehicles with similar attributes are indistinguishable from one another due to image quality issues. Often, network bandwidth and power constraints limit the frame rate, as well. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of performing vehicle tracking queries over video streams from ubiquitous traffic cameras. We identify the limitations of tracking vehicles individually in such conditions and provide a novel graph-based approach using the identity of neighboring vehicles to improve the performance. We evaluate our approach using streaming video feeds from live traffic cameras available on the Internet. The results show that vehicle tracking is feasible, even for low quality and low frame rate traffic cameras. Additionally, exploitation of the attributes of neighboring vehicles significantly improves the performance.

    :abstractText: We address the problem of finding a "best" deterministic query answer to a query over a probabilistic database. For this purpose, we propose the notion of a consensus world (or a consensus answer) which is a deterministic world (answer) that minimizes the expected distance to the possible worlds (answers). This problem can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied inconsistent information aggregation problems (e.g. rank aggregation) to probabilistic databases. We consider this problem for various types of queries including SPJ queries, Top-k ranking queries, group-by aggregate queries, and clustering. For different distance metrics, we obtain polynomial time optimal or approximation algorithms for computing the consensus answers (or prove NP-hardness). Most of our results are for a general probabilistic database model, called and/xor tree model, which significantly generalizes previous probabilistic database models like x-tuples and block-independent disjoint models, and is of independent interest.

    :abstractText: The dramatic growth in the number of application domains that naturally generate probabilistic, uncertain data has resulted in a need for efficiently supporting complex querying and decision-making over such data. In this paper, we present a unified approach to ranking and top-k query processing in probabilistic databases by viewing it as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and by deriving a set of features that capture the key properties of a probabilistic dataset that dictate the ranked result. We contend that a single, specific ranking function may not suffice for probabilistic databases, and we instead propose two parameterized ranking functions, called PRF&omega; and PRFe, that generalize or can approximate many of the previously proposed ranking functions. We present novel generating functions-based algorithms for efficiently ranking large datasets according to these ranking functions, even if the datasets exhibit complex correlations modeled using probabilistic and/xor trees or Markov networks. We further propose that the parameters of the ranking function be learned from user preferences, and we develop an approach to learn those parameters. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental study that illustrates the effectiveness of our parameterized ranking functions, especially PRFe, at approximating other ranking functions and the scalability of our proposed algorithms for exact or approximate ranking.

    :abstractText: An eddy [2] is a highly adaptive query processing operator that continuously reoptimizes a query in response to changing runtime conditions. It does this by treating query processing as routing of tuples through operators and making per-tuple routing decisions. The benefits of such adaptivity can be significant, especially in highly dynamic environments such as data streams, sensor query processing, web querying, etc. Various parties have asserted that the cost of making per-tuple routing decisions is prohibitive. We have implemented eddies in the PostgreSQL open source database system [1] in the context of the TelegraphCQ project. In this paper, we present an "apples-to-apples" comparison of PostgreSQL query processing overhead with and without eddies. Our results show that with some minor tuning, the overhead of the eddy mechanism is negligible.

Research on sensor networks spans many areas of computer science, and there are now major conferences, e.g., IPSN and SenSys, devoted to sensor networks. However, there is no focused forum for discussion of early and innovative work on data management in sensor networks.

    :abstractText: "Pipelined filter ordering is a central problem in database query optimization. The problem is to determine the optimal order in which to apply a given set of commutative filters (predicates) to a set of elements (the tuples of a relation), so as to find, as efficiently as possible, the tuples that satisfy all of the filters. Optimization of pipelined filter ordering has recently received renewed attention in the context of environments such as the Web, continuous high-speed data streams, and sensor networks. Pipelined filter ordering problems are also studied in areas such as fault detection and machine learning under names such as learning with attribute costs, minimum-sum set cover, and satisficing search. We present algorithms for two natural extensions of the classical pipelined filter ordering problem: (1) a distributional-type problem where the filters run in parallel and the goal is to maximize throughput, and (2) an adversarial-type problem where the goal is to minimize the expected value of multiplicative regret. We present two related algorithms for solving (1), both running in time O(n2), which improve on the O(n3 log n) algorithm of Kodialam. We use techniques from our algorithms for (1) to obtain an algorithm for (2)."

    :abstractText: As the data management field has diversified to consider settings in which queries are increasingly complex, statistics are less available, or data is stored remotely, there has been an acknowledgment that the traditional optimize-then-execute paradigm is insufficient. This has led to a plethora of new techniques, generally placed under the common banner of adaptive query processing, that focus on using runtime feed-back to modify query processing in a way that provides better response time or more efficient CPU utilization. In this survey paper, we identify many of the common issues, themes, and approaches that pervade this work, and the settings in which each piece of work is most appropriate. Our goal with this paper is to be a "value-add" over the existing papers on the material, providing not only a brief overview of each technique, but also a basic framework for understanding the field of adaptive query processing in general. We focus primarily on intra-query adaptivity of long-running, but not full-fledged streaming, queries. We conclude with a discussion of open research problems that are of high importance.

In particular, we exploit what we refer to as shared correlations where the same uncertainties and correlations occur repeatedly in the data. Shared correlations occur mainly due to two reasons: (1) Uncertainty and correlations usually come from general statistics and rarely vary on a tuple-to-tuple basis; (2) The query evaluation procedure itself tends to re-introduce the same correlations. Prior work has shown that the query evaluation problem on probabilistic databases is equivalent to a probabilistic inference problem on an appropriately constructed probabilistic graphical model (PGM). We leverage this by introducing a new data structure, called the random variable elimination graph (rv-elim graph) that can be built from the PGM obtained from query evaluation. We develop techniques based on bisimulation that can be used to compress the rv-elim graph exploiting the presence of shared correlations in the PGM, the compressed rv-elim graph can then be used to run inference. We validate our methods by evaluating them empirically and show that even with a few shared correlations significant speed-ups are possible."

    :abstractText: We address the problem of finding a "best" deterministic query answer to a query over a probabilistic database. For this purpose, we propose the notion of a consensus world (or a consensus answer) which is a deterministic world (answer) that minimizes the expected distance to the possible worlds (answers). This problem can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied inconsistent information aggregation problems (e.g. rank aggregation) to probabilistic databases. We consider this problem for various types of queries including SPJ queries, Top-k ranking queries, group-by aggregate queries, and clustering. For different distance metrics, we obtain polynomial time optimal or approximation algorithms for computing the consensus answers (or prove NP-hardness). Most of our results are for a general probabilistic database model, called and/xor tree model, which significantly generalizes previous probabilistic database models like x-tuples and block-independent disjoint models, and is of independent interest.

    :abstractText: With large amounts of correlated probabilistic data being generated in a wide range of application domains including sensor networks, information extraction, event detection etc., effectively managing and querying them has become an important research direction. While there is an exhaustive body of literature on querying independent probabilistic data, supporting efficient queries over large-scale, correlated databases remains a challenge. In this paper, we develop efficient data structures and indexes for supporting inference and decision support queries over such databases. Our proposed hierarchical data structure is suitable both for in-memory and disk-resident databases. We represent the correlations in the probabilistic database using a junction tree over the tuple-existence or attribute-value random variables, and use tree partitioning techniques to build an index structure over it. We show how to efficiently answer inference and aggregation queries using such an index, resulting in orders of magnitude performance benefits in most cases. In addition, we develop novel algorithms for efficiently keeping the index structure up-to-date as changes (inserts, updates) are made to the probabilistic database. We present a comprehensive experimental study illustrating the benefits of our approach to query processing in probabilistic databases.

    :abstractText: Increasing numbers of real-world application domains are generating data that is inherently noisy, incomplete, and probabilistic in nature. Statistical inference and probabilistic modeling often introduce another layer of uncertainty on top of that. Examples of such data include measurement data collected by sensor networks, observation data in the context of social networks, scientific and biomedical data, and data collected by various online cyber-sources. Over the last few years, numerous approaches have been proposed, and several systems built, to integrate uncertainty into databases. However, these approaches typically make simplistic and restrictive assumptions concerning the types of uncertainties that can be represented. Most importantly, they often make highly restrictive independence assumptions, and cannot easily model rich correlations among the tuples or attribute values. Furthermore, they typically lack support for specifying uncertainties at different levels of abstractions, needed to handle large-scale uncertain datasets.

    :abstractText: "Due to numerous applications producing noisy data, e.g., sensor data, experimental data, data from uncurated sources, information extraction, etc., there has been a surge of interest in the development of probabilistic databases. Most probabilistic database models proposed to date, however, fail to meet the challenges of real-world applications on two counts: (1) they often restrict the kinds of uncertainty that the user can represent; and (2) the query processing algorithms often cannot scale up to the needs of the application. In this work, we define a probabilistic database model, PrDB, that uses graphical models, a state-of-the-art probabilistic modeling technique developed within the statistics and machine learning community, to model uncertain data. We show how this results in a rich, complex yet compact probabilistic database model, which can capture the commonly occurring uncertainty models (tuple uncertainty, attribute uncertainty), more complex models (correlated tuples and attributes) and allows compact representation (shared and schema-level correlations). In addition, we show how query evaluation in PrDB translates into inference in an appropriately augmented graphical model. This allows us to easily use any of a myriad of exact and approximate inference algorithms developed within the graphical modeling community. While probabilistic inference provides a generic approach to solving queries, we show how the use of shared correlations, together with a novel inference algorithm that we developed based on bisimulation, can speed query processing significantly. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques and show that even with a few shared correlations, significant speedups are possible."

    :abstractText: The dramatic growth in the number of application domains that naturally generate probabilistic, uncertain data has resulted in a need for efficiently supporting complex querying and decision-making over such data. In this paper, we present a unified approach to ranking and top-k query processing in probabilistic databases by viewing it as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and by deriving a set of features that capture the key properties of a probabilistic dataset that dictate the ranked result. We contend that a single, specific ranking function may not suffice for probabilistic databases, and we instead propose two parameterized ranking functions, called PRF&omega; and PRFe, that generalize or can approximate many of the previously proposed ranking functions. We present novel generating functions-based algorithms for efficiently ranking large datasets according to these ranking functions, even if the datasets exhibit complex correlations modeled using probabilistic and/xor trees or Markov networks. We further propose that the parameters of the ranking function be learned from user preferences, and we develop an approach to learn those parameters. Finally, we present a comprehensive experimental study that illustrates the effectiveness of our parameterized ranking functions, especially PRFe, at approximating other ranking functions and the scalability of our proposed algorithms for exact or approximate ranking.

    :abstractText: Increasing numbers of real-world application domains are generating data that is inherently noisy, incomplete, and probabilistic in nature. Statistical analysis and probabilistic inference, widely used in those domains, often introduce additional layers of uncertainty. Examples include sensor data analysis, data integration and information extraction on the Web, social network analysis, and scientific and biomedical data management. Managing and querying such data requires us to combine the tools and the techniques from a variety of disciplines including databases, first-order logic, and probabilistic reasoning. There has been much work at the intersection of these research areas in recent years. The work on probabilistic databases has made great advances in efficiently executing SQL and inference queries over large-scale uncertain datasets [2, 1]. The research in first-order probabilistic models like probabilistic relational models [5], Markov logic networks [10] etc. (see Getoor and Taskar [6] for a comprehensive overview), and the work on lifted inference [9, 3, 8, 11] has resulted in several techniques for efficiently integrating first-order logic and probabilistic reasoning. In this talk, I will present some of the foundations of large-scale probabilistic data management, and the challenges in scaling the representational power and the reasoning capabilities of probabilistic databases. I will use the PrDB probabilistic data management system being developed at the University of Maryland as a case study for this purpose [4, 7, 12]. Unlike the other recent work on probabilistic databases, PrDB is designed to represent uncertain data with rich correlation structures, and it uses probabilistic graphical models as the basic representation model. I will discuss how PrDB supports compact specification of uncertainties at different abstraction levels, from "schema-level" uncertainties that apply to entire relations to "tuple-specific" uncertainties that apply to a specific tuple or a specific set of tuples; I will also discuss how this relates to the work on first-order probabilistic models. Query evaluation in PrDB can be formulated as inference in appropriately constructed graphical models, and I will briefly present some of the key novel techniques that we have developed for efficient query evaluation, and their relationship to recent work on efficient lifted inference. I will conclude with a discussion of some of the open research challenges moving forward.

    :abstractText: "We address the problem of efficiently gathering correlated data from a wireless sensor network, with the aim of designing algorithms with provable optimality guarantees, and understanding how close we can get to the known theoretical lower bounds. Our proposed approach is based on finding an optimal or a near-optimal compression tree for a given sensor network: a compression tree is a directed tree over the sensor network nodes such that the value of a node is compressed using the value of its parent. We focus on broadcast communication model in this paper, but our results are more generally applicable to a unicast communication model as well. We draw connections between the data collection problem and a previously studied graph concept called weakly connected dominating sets, and we use this to develop novel approximation algorithms for the problem. We present comparative results on several synthetic and real-world datasets showing that our algorithms construct near-optimal compression trees that yield a significant reduction in the data collection cost."

    :abstractText: "In this paper, we address the problem of scalably evaluating conjunctive queries over correlated probabilistic databases containing tuple or attribute uncertainties. Like previous work, we adopt a two-phase approach where we first compute lineages of the output tuples, and then compute the probabilities of the lineage formulas. However unlike previous work, we allow for arbitrary and complex correlations to be present in the data, captured via a forest of junction trees. We observe that evaluating even read-once (tree structured) lineages (e.g., those generated by hierarchical conjunctive queries), polynomially computable over tuple independent probabilistic databases, is #P-complete for lightly correlated probabilistic databases like Markov sequences. We characterize the complexity of exact computation of the probability of the lineage formula on a correlated database using a parameter called lwidth (analogous to the notion of treewidth). For lineages that result in low lwidth, we compute exact probabilities using a novel message passing algorithm, and for lineages that induce large lwidths, we develop approximate Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate the result probabilities. We scale our algorithms to very large correlated probabilistic databases using the previously proposed INDSEP data structure. To mitigate the complexity of lineage evaluation, we develop optimization techniques to process a batch of lineages by sharing computation across formulas, and to exploit any independence relationships that may exist in the data. Our experimental study illustrates the benefits of using our algorithms for processing lineage formulas over correlated probabilistic databases."

    :abstractText: Sensors capable of sensing phenomena at high data rates on the order of tens to hundreds of thousands of samples per second are now widely deployed in many industrial, civil engineering, scientific, networking, and medical applications. In aggregate, these sensors easily generate several million samples per second that must be processed within milliseconds or seconds. The computation required includes both signal processing and event stream processing. XStream is a stream processing system for such applications. XStream introduces a new data type, the signal segment, which allows applications to manipulate isochronous (regularly spaced in time) collections of sensor samples more conveniently and efficiently than the asynchronous representation used in previous work. XStream includes a memory manager and scheduler optimizations tuned for processing signal segments at high speeds. In benchmark comparisons, we show that XStream outperforms a leading commercial stream processing system by more than three orders of magnitude. On one application, the commercial system processed 72.7 Ksamples/sec, while XStream processed 97.6 Msamples/sec.

    :abstractText: US water utilities are faced with mounting operational and maintenance costs as a result of aging pipeline infrastructures. Leaks and ruptures in water supply pipelines and blockages and overflow events in sewer collectors cost millions of dollars a year, and monitoring and repairing this underground infrastructure presents a severe challenge. In this paper, we discuss how wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of operational data from pipeline infrastructures and thus address the challenge of near real-time monitoring and eventually control. We focus on the use of WSNs for monitoring large diameter bulk-water transmission pipelines. We outline a system, PipeNet, we have been developing for collecting hydraulic and acoustic/vibration data at high sampling rates as well as algorithms for analyzing this data to detect and locate leaks. Challenges include sampling at high data rates, maintaining aggressive duty cycles, and ensuring tightly time-synchronized data collection, all under a strict power budget. We have carried out an extensive field trial with Boston Water and Sewer Commission in order to evaluate some of the critical components of PipeNet. Along with the results of this preliminary trial, we describe the results of extensive laboratory experiments which are used to evaluate our analysis and data processing solutions. Our prototype deployment has led to the development of a reusable, field-reprogrammable software infrastructure for distributed high-rate signal processing in wireless sensor networks, which we also describe.

    :abstractText: Distributed acoustic sensing underlies an increasingly important class of sensor network applications, from habitat monitoring and bio acoustic census to security applications and virtual fences. VoxNet is a complete hardware and software platform for distributed acoustic monitoring applications that focuses on three key goals:(1) rapid deployment in realistic environments;(2) a high level programming language that abstracts the user from platform and network details and compiles into a high performance distributed application; and(3) an interactive usage model based on run-time installable programs, with the ability to run the same high level program seamlessly over live or stored data. The VoxNet hardware is self-contained and weather-resistant, and supports a four-channel microphone array with automated time synchronization, localization, and network coordination. Using VoxNet, an investigator can visualize phenomena in real-time, develop and tune on-line analysis, and record raw data for off-line analysis and archival. This paper describes both the hardware and software elements of the platform, as well as the architecture required to support distributed programs running over a heterogeneous network.We characterize the performance of the platform, using both microbenchmarks that evaluate specific aspects of the platform and a real application running in the field.

    :abstractText: Applications that combine live data streams with embedded, parallel, and distributed processing are becoming more commonplace. WaveScript is a domain-specific language that brings high-level, type-safe, garbage-collected programming to these domains. This is made possible by three primary implementation techniques, each of which leverages characteristics of the streaming domain. First, we employ a novel evaluation strategy that uses a combination of interpretation and reification to partially evaluate programs into stream dataflow graphs. Second, we use profile-driven compilation to enable many optimizations that are normally only available in the synchronous (rather than asynchronous) dataflow domain. Finally, we incorporate an extensible system for rewrite rules to capture algebraic properties in specific domains (such as signal processing). We have used our language to build and deploy a sensornetwork for the acoustic localization of wild animals, in particular, the Yellow-Bellied marmot. We evaluate WaveScript's performance on this application, showing that it yields good performance on both embedded and desktop-class machines, including distributed execution and substantial parallel speedups. Our language allowed us to implement the application rapidly, while outperforming a previous C implementation by over 35%, using fewer than half the lines of code. We evaluate the contribution of our optimizations to this success.

    :abstractText: "The impressive penetration of 802.11-based wireless networks in many metropolitan areas around the world offers, for the first time, the opportunity of a \"grassroots\" wireless Internet service provided by users who \"open up\" their 802.11 (Wi-Fi) access points in a controlled manner to mobile clients. While there are many business, legal, and policy issues to be ironed out for this vision to become reality, we are concerned in this paper with an important technical question surrounding such a system: can such an unplanned network service provide reasonable performance to network clients moving in cars at vehicular speeds.To answer this question, we present the results of a measurement study carried out over 290 \"drive hours\" over a few cars under typical driving conditions, in and around the Boston metropolitan area (some of our data also comes from a car in Seattle). With a simple caching optimization to speed-up IP address acquisition, we find that for our driving patterns the median duration of link-layer connectivity at vehicular speeds is 13 seconds, the median connection upload bandwidth is 30 KBytes/s, and that the mean duration between successful associations to APs is 75 seconds. We also find that connections are equally probable across a range of urban speeds (up to 60 km/hour in our measurements). Our end-to-end TCP upload experiments had a median throughput of about 30 KBytes/s, which is consistent with typical uplink speeds of home broadband links in the US. The median TCP connection is capable of uploading about 216 KBytes of data.Our high-level conclusion is that grassroots Wi-Fi networks are viable for a variety of applications, particularly ones that can tolerate intermittent connectivity. We discuss how our measurement results can improve transport protocols in such networks."

    :abstractText: "Cabernet is a system for delivering data to and from moving vehicles using open 802.11 (WiFi) access points encountered opportunistically during travel. Using open WiFi access from the road can be challenging. Network connectivity in Cabernet is both fleeting (access points are typically within range for a few seconds) and intermittent (because the access points do not provide continuous coverage), and suffers from high packet loss rates over the wireless channel. On the positive side, WiFi data transfers, when available, can occur at broadband speeds. In this paper, we introduce two new components for improving openWiFi data delivery to moving vehicles: The first, QuickWiFi, is a streamlined client-side process to establish end-to-end connectivity, reducing mean connection time to less than 400 ms, from over 10 seconds when using standard wireless networking software. The second part, CTP, is a transport protocol that distinguishes congestion on the wired portion of the path from losses over the wireless link, resulting in a 2x throughput improvement over TCP. To characterize the amount of open WiFi capacity available to vehicular users, we deployed Cabernet on a fleet of 10 taxis in the Boston area. The long-term average transfer rate achieved was approximately 38 Mbytes/hour per car (86 kbit/s), making Cabernet a viable system for a number of non-interactive applications."

We describe a system and associated algorithms to monitor this important civil infrastructure using a collection of sensor-equipped vehicles. This system, which we call the Pothole Patrol (P2), uses the inherent mobility of the participating vehicles, opportunistically gathering data from vibration and GPS sensors, and processing the data to assess road surface conditions. We have deployed P2 on 7 taxis running in the Boston area. Using a simple machine-learning approach, we show that we are able to identify potholes and other severe road surface anomalies from accelerometer data. Via careful selection of training data and signal features, we have been able to build a detector that misidentifies good road segments as having potholes less than 0.2% of the time. We evaluate our system on data from thousands of kilometers of taxi drives, and show that it can successfully detect a number of real potholes in and around the Boston area. After clustering to further reduce spurious detections, manual inspection of reported potholes shows that over 90% contain road anomalies in need of repair."

    :abstractText: "We propose an energy-efficient framework, called SAF, for approximate querying and clustering of nodes in a sensor network. SAF uses simple time series forecasting models to predict sensor readings. The idea is to build these local models at each node, transmit them to the root of the network (the \"sink\"), and use them to approximately answer user queries. Our approach dramatically reduces communication relative to previous approaches for querying sensor networks by exploiting properties of these local models, since each sensor communicates with the sink only when its local model varies due to changes in the underlying data distribution. In our experimental results performed on a trace of real data, we observed on average about 150 message transmissions from each sensor over a week (including the learning phase) to correctly predict temperatures to within +/- 0.5\xC2\xB0C.SAF also provides a mechanism to detect data similarities between nodes and organize nodes into clusters at the sink at no additional communication cost. This is again achieved by exploiting properties of our local time series models, and by means of a novel definition of data similarity between nodes that is based not on raw data but on the prediction values. Our clustering algorithm is both very efficient and provably optimal in the number of clusters. Our clusters have several interesting features: first, they can capture similarity between far away nodes that are not geographically adjacent; second, cluster membership to variations in sensors' local models; third, nodes within a cluster are not required to track the membership of other nodes in the cluster. We present a number of simulation-based experimental results that demonstrate these properties of SAF."

    :abstractText: CarTel is a mobile sensor computing system designed to collect, process, deliver, and visualize data from sensors located on mobile units such as automobiles. A CarTel node is a mobile embedded computer coupled to a set of sensors. Each node gathers and processes sensor readings locally before delivering them to a central portal, where the data is stored in a database for further analysis and visualization. In the automotive context, a variety of on-board and external sensors collect data as users drive.CarTel provides a simple query-oriented programming interface, handles large amounts of heterogeneous data from sensors, and handles intermittent and variable network connectivity. CarTel nodes rely primarily on opportunistic wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) connectivity to the Internet, or to "data mules" such as other CarTel nodes, mobile phone flash memories, or USB keys-to communicate with the portal. CarTel applications run on the portal, using a delay-tolerant continuous query processor, ICEDB, to specify how the mobile nodes should summarize, filter, and dynamically prioritize data. The portal and the mobile nodes use a delay-tolerant network stack, CafNet, to communicat.CarTel has been deployed on six cars, running on a small scale in Boston and Seattle for over a year. It has been used to analyze commute times, analyze metropolitan Wi-Fi deployments, and for automotive diagnostics.

    :abstractText: "WaveScope is a data management and continuous sensor data system that integrates relational database and signal processing operations into a single system. WaveScope is motivated by a large number of signal-oriented streaming sensor applications, such as: preventive maintenance of industrial equipment; detection of fractures and ruptures in various structures; in situ animal behavior studies using acoustic sensing; network traffic analysis; and medical applications such as anomaly detection in EKGs. These target applications use a variety of embedded sensors, each sampling at fine resolution and producing data at high rates ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands of samples per second. Though there has been some work on applications in the sensor network community that do this kind of signal processing (for example, shooter localization [5], industrial equipment monitoring [4], and urban infrastructure monitoring [2]), these applications are typically custombuilt and do not provide reusable high-level programming framework suitable for easily building new signal processing applications with similar functionality. This poster shows how WaveScope supports these types of application in a single, unified framework, providing both high run-time performance and easy application development."

    :abstractText: Column-oriented database system architectures invite a re-evaluation of how and when data in databases is compressed. Storing data in a column-oriented fashion greatly increases the similarity of adjacent records on disk and thus opportunities for compression. The ability to compress many adjacent tuples at once lowers the per-tuple cost of compression, both in terms of CPU and space overheads.In this paper, we discuss how we extended C-Store (a column-oriented DBMS) with a compression sub-system. We show how compression schemes not traditionally used in row-oriented DBMSs can be applied to column-oriented systems. We then evaluate a set of compression schemes and show that the best scheme depends not only on the properties of the data but also on the nature of the query workload.

    :abstractText: "Over the past few years, Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) have emerged as a new class of software systems, enabling low latency processing of streams of data arriving at high rates. As SPEs mature and get used in monitoring applications that must continuously run (e.g., in network security monitoring), a significant challenge arises: SPEs must be able to handle various software and hardware faults that occur, masking them to provide high availability (HA). In this article, we develop, implement, and evaluate DPC (Delay, Process, and Correct), a protocol to handle crash failures of processing nodes and network failures in a distributed SPE. Like previous approaches to HA, DPC uses replication and masks many types of node and network failures. In the presence of network partitions, the designer of any replication system faces a choice between providing availability or data consistency across the replicas. In DPC, this choice is made explicit: the user specifies an availability bound (no result should be delayed by more than a specified delay threshold even under failure if the corresponding input is available), and DPC attempts to minimize the resulting inconsistency between replicas (not all of which might have seen the input data) while meeting the given delay threshold. Although conceptually simple, the DPC protocol tolerates the occurrence of multiple simultaneous failures as well as any further failures that occur during recovery. This article describes DPC and its implementation in the Borealis SPE. We show that DPC enables a distributed SPE to maintain low-latency processing at all times, while also achieving eventual consistency, where applications eventually receive the complete and correct output streams. Furthermore, we show that, independent of system size and failure location, it is possible to handle failures almost up-to the user-specified bound in a manner that meets the required availability without introducing any inconsistency."

    :abstractText: Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases include a suite of features - disk-resident B-trees and heap files, locking-based concurrency control, support for multi-threading - that were optimized for computer technology of the late 1970's. Advances in modern processors, memories, and networks mean that today's computers are vastly different from those of 30 years ago, such that many OLTP databases will now fit in main memory, and most OLTP transactions can be processed in milliseconds or less. Yet database architecture has changed little. Based on this observation, we look at some interesting variants of conventional database systems that one might build that exploit recent hardware trends, and speculate on their performance through a detailed instruction-level breakdown of the major components involved in a transaction processing database system (Shore) running a subset of TPC-C. Rather than simply profiling Shore, we progressively modified it so that after every feature removal or optimization, we had a (faster) working system that fully ran our workload. Overall, we identify overheads and optimizations that explain a total difference of about a factor of 20x in raw performance. We also show that there is no single "high pole in the tent" in modern (memory resident) database systems, but that substantial time is spent in logging, latching, locking, B-tree, and buffer management operations.

    :abstractText: "Many scientific, financial, data mining and sensor network applications need to work with continuous, rather than discrete data e.g., temperature as a function of location, or stock prices or vehicle trajectories as a function of time. Querying raw or discrete data is unsatisfactory for these applications -- e.g., in a sensor network, it is necessary to interpolate sensor readings to predict values at locations where sensors are not deployed. In other situations, raw data can be inaccurate owing to measurement errors, and it is useful to fit continuous functions to raw data and query the functions, rather than raw data itself -- e.g., fitting a smooth curve to noisy sensor readings, or a smooth trajectory to GPS data containing gaps or outliers. Existing databases do not support storing or querying continuous functions, short of brute-force discretization of functions into a collection of tuples. We present FunctionDB, a novel database system that treats mathematical functions as first-class citizens that can be queried like traditional relations. The key contribution of FunctionDB is an efficient and accurate algebraic query processor - for the broad class of multi-variable polynomial functions, FunctionDB executes queries directly on the algebraic representation of functions without materializing them into discrete points, using symbolic operations: zero finding, variable substitution, and integration. Even when closed form solutions are intractable, FunctionDB leverages symbolic approximation operations to improve performance. We evaluate FunctionDB on real data sets from a temperature sensor network, and on traffic traces from Boston roads. We show that operating in the functional domain has substantial advantages in terms of accuracy (15-30%) and up to order of magnitude (10x-100x) performance wins over existing approaches that represent models as discrete collections of points."

    :abstractText: "There has been a significant amount of excitement and recent work on column-oriented database systems (\"column-stores\"). These database systems have been shown to perform more than an order of magnitude better than traditional row-oriented database systems (\"row-stores\") on analytical workloads such as those found in data warehouses, decision support, and business intelligence applications. The elevator pitch behind this performance difference is straightforward: column-stores are more I/O efficient for read-only queries since they only have to read from disk (or from memory) those attributes accessed by a query. This simplistic view leads to the assumption that one can obtain the performance benefits of a column-store using a row-store: either by vertically partitioning the schema, or by indexing every column so that columns can be accessed independently. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is false. We compare the performance of a commercial row-store under a variety of different configurations with a column-store and show that the row-store performance is significantly slower on a recently proposed data warehouse benchmark. We then analyze the performance difference and show that there are some important differences between the two systems at the query executor level (in addition to the obvious differences at the storage layer level). Using the column-store, we then tease apart these differences, demonstrating the impact on performance of a variety of column-oriented query execution techniques, including vectorized query processing, compression, and a new join algorithm we introduce in this paper. We conclude that while it is not impossible for a row-store to achieve some of the performance advantages of a column-store, changes must be made to both the storage layer and the query executor to fully obtain the benefits of a column-oriented approach."

    :abstractText: This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of areplication scheme to handle Byzantine faults in transaction processing database systems. The scheme compares answers from queries and updates on multiple replicas which are unmodified, off-the-shelf systems, to provide a single database that is Byzantine fault tolerant. The scheme works when the replicas are homogeneous, but it also allows heterogeneous replication in which replicas come from different vendors. Heterogeneous replicas reduce the impact of bugs and security compromises because they are implemented independently and are thus less likely to suffer correlated failures. The main challenge in designing a replication scheme for transactionprocessing systems is ensuring that the different replicas execute transactions in equivalent serial orders while allowing a high degreeof concurrency. Our scheme meets this goal using a novel concurrency control protocol, commit barrier scheduling (CBS). We have implemented CBS in the context of a replicated SQL database, HRDB(Heterogeneous Replicated DB), which has been tested with unmodified production versions of several commercial and open source databases as replicas. Our experiments show an HRDB configuration that can tolerate one faulty replica has only a modest performance overhead(about 17% for the TPC-C benchmark). HRDB successfully masks several Byzantine faults observed in practice and we have used it to find a new bug in MySQL.

By integrating the two query processing systems, the optimization goals of the sensor network (primarily power) and server network (primarily latency and quality) can be unified into one quality of service metric. The demo shows various steps of the unified optimization process for a sample query where the effects of each step that the optimizer takes can be directly viewed using a quality of service monitor. Our demo includes sensors deployed in the demo area in a tiny mockup of a factory application.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a set of algorithms for efficiently evaluating join queries over static data tables in sensor networks. We describe and evaluate three algorithms that take advantage of distributed join techniques. Our algorithms are capable of running in limited amounts of RAM, can distribute the storage burden over groups of nodes, and are tolerant to dropped packets and node failures. REED is thus suitable for a wide range of event-detection applications that traditional sensor network database and data collection systems cannot be used to implement.

    :abstractText: Database systems have traditionally optimized performance for write-intensive workloads. Recently, there has been renewed interest in architectures that optimize read performance by using column-oriented data representation and light-weight compression. This previous work has shown that under certain broad classes of workloads, column-based systems can outperform row-based systems. Previous work, however, has not characterized the precise conditions under which a particular query workload can be expected to perform better on a column-oriented database.In this paper we first identify the distinctive components of a read-optimized DBMS and describe our implementation of a high-performance query engine that can operate on both row and column-oriented data. We then use our prototype to perform an in-depth analysis of the tradeoffs between column and row-oriented architectures. We explore these tradeoffs in terms of disk bandwidth, CPU cache latency, and CPU cycles. We show that for most database workloads, a carefully designed column system can outperform a carefully designed row system, sometimes by an order of magnitude. We also present an analytical model to predict whether a given workload on a particular hardware configuration is likely to perform better on a row or column-based system.

    :abstractText: Any highly available data warehouse will use some form of data replication to tolerate machine failures. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can leverage this data redundancy to build an integrated approach to recovery and high availability. Our approach, called HARBOR, revives a crashed site by querying remote, online sites for missing updates and uses timestamps to determine which tuples need to be copied or updated. HARBOR does not require a stable log, recovers without quiescing the system, allows replicated data to be stored non-identically, and is simpler than a log-based recovery algorithm.We compare the runtime overhead and recovery performance of HARBOR to those of two-phase commit and ARIES, the gold standard for log-based recovery, on a three-node distributed database system. Our experiments demonstrate that HARBOR suffers lower runtime overhead, has recovery performance comparable to ARIES's, and can tolerate the fault of a worker and efficiently bring it back online.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents the design of a read-optimized relational DBMS that contrasts sharply with most current systems, which are write-optimized. Among the many differences in its design are: storage of data by column rather than by row, careful coding and packing of objects into storage including main memory during query processing, storing an overlapping collection of column-oriented projections, rather than the current fare of tables and indexes, a non-traditional implementation of transactions which includes high availability and snapshot isolation for read-only transactions, and the extensive use of bitmap indexes to complement B-tree structures.We present preliminary performance data on a subset of TPC-H and show that the system we are building, C-Store, is substantially faster than popular commercial products. Hence, the architecture looks very encouraging."

    :abstractText: In previous papers [SC05, SBC+07], some of us predicted the end of "one size fits all" as a commercial relational DBMS paradigm. These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1--2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a "one size fits all" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of "from scratch" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow's requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday's needs.

    :abstractText: "Efficient management of RDF data is an important factor in realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables.\" We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds."

    :abstractText: We show how the database community's notion of a generic query interface for data aggregation can be applied to ad-hoc networks of sensor devices. As has been noted in the sensor network literature, aggregation is important as a data-reduction tool; networking approaches, however, have focused on application specific solutions, whereas our in-networkaggregation approach is driven by a general purpose, SQL-style interface that can execute queries over any type of sensor data while providing opportunities for significant optimization. We present a variety of techniques to improve the reliability and performance of our solution.We also show how grouped aggregates can be efficiently computed and offer a comparison to related systems and database projects.

    :abstractText: The wireless sensor network community approached networking abstractions as an open question, allowing answers to emerge with time and experience. The Trickle algorithm has become a basic mechanism used in numerous protocols and systems. Trickle brings nodes to eventual consistency quickly and efficiently while remaining remarkably robust to variations in network density, topology, and dynamics. Instead of flooding a network with packets, Trickle uses a "polite gossip" policy to control send rates so each node hears just enough packets to stay consistent. This simple mechanism enables Trickle to scale to 1000-fold changes in network density, reach consistency in seconds, and require only a few bytes of state yet impose a maintenance cost of a few sends an hour. Originally designed for disseminating new code, experience has shown Trickle to have much broader applicability, including route maintenance and neighbor discovery. This paper provides an overview of the research challenges wireless sensor networks face, describes the Trickle algorithm, and outlines several ways it is used today.

    :abstractText: The TOADS system is an innovative tool for building interior-space virtual environments (VEs) in two dimensions. Existing VE design tools typically operate in three dimensions, which makes it difficult to manipulate objects on the inherently two-dimensional computer screen. TOADS allows nearly the same functionality as those three-dimensional systems in an easy-to-use, two-dimensional environment. Users edit and enhance DXF floorplans with height and texture information. The software includes an inference engine that automatically identifies doors in the floorplan and generates openable polygons in the final environment. It also includes a sophisticated mechanism for embedding complex textures, such as transparent windows, at arbitrary heights in wall polygons. The entire interface is integrated with software that drives a custom texture-acquisition device. This device consists of a rack-mounted camera that captures narrow bands of textures and tiles them together to form long, continuous swaths of texture. This paper summarizes these tools and their function, and presents examples of environments that were generated with them.

    :abstractText: Starting with the 2001 SIGMOD conference, the SIGMOD Chair, in consultation with the SIGMOD Advisory Committee, imposed a double blind rule on all future SIGMOD conferences. While there are many reasons why double-blind reviewing might be a good idea, the one most frequently cited is that it is fairer to more junior researchers. It is not, however, without its problems, including anecdotal reports of papers being rejected because their authors failed to cite their own papers as related work in order to not violate the anonymity rules and a complication of the job of the program chair who must interpret and enforce the double-blind rules. One very qualified individual turned down an offer to be PC chair of an upcoming SIGMOD conference because he did not want to have to deal with the headaches of double-blind reviewing.

    :abstractText: "Over the past few years, Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) have emerged as a new class of software systems, enabling low latency processing of streams of data arriving at high rates. As SPEs mature and get used in monitoring applications that must continuously run (e.g., in network security monitoring), a significant challenge arises: SPEs must be able to handle various software and hardware faults that occur, masking them to provide high availability (HA). In this article, we develop, implement, and evaluate DPC (Delay, Process, and Correct), a protocol to handle crash failures of processing nodes and network failures in a distributed SPE. Like previous approaches to HA, DPC uses replication and masks many types of node and network failures. In the presence of network partitions, the designer of any replication system faces a choice between providing availability or data consistency across the replicas. In DPC, this choice is made explicit: the user specifies an availability bound (no result should be delayed by more than a specified delay threshold even under failure if the corresponding input is available), and DPC attempts to minimize the resulting inconsistency between replicas (not all of which might have seen the input data) while meeting the given delay threshold. Although conceptually simple, the DPC protocol tolerates the occurrence of multiple simultaneous failures as well as any further failures that occur during recovery. This article describes DPC and its implementation in the Borealis SPE. We show that DPC enables a distributed SPE to maintain low-latency processing at all times, while also achieving eventual consistency, where applications eventually receive the complete and correct output streams. Furthermore, we show that, independent of system size and failure location, it is possible to handle failures almost up-to the user-specified bound in a manner that meets the required availability without introducing any inconsistency."

    :abstractText: "Efficient management of RDF data is an important prerequisite for realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance of RDF databases and consider a recent suggestion, \"property tables\". We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the RDF data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based RDF browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertically partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented DBMS (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented DBMS, another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds. Encouraged by these results, we describe the architecture of SW-Store, a new DBMS we are actively building that implements these techniques to achieve high performance RDF data management."

    :abstractText: We propose EndoScope, a software monitoring framework that allows users to pose declarative queries that monitor the state and performance of running programs. Unlike most existing monitoring tools, EndoScope is acquisitional, meaning that it only instruments the portions of the program that need to be monitored to answer queries. The use of a high level declarative language allows EndoScope to search for efficient physical instantiations of queries by applying a suite of optimizations, including control flow graph analysis, and traditional database query optimization techniques, such as predicate pushdown and join optimization, to minimize the number of program instrumentation points and overhead to the monitored program. Furthermore, a flexible, high level language and the ability to attach to running programs enable developers to build various program analysis and monitoring applications beyond traditional software profilers with EndoScope. We describe a prototype implementation of the EndoScope framework and a simple profiler for Java programs implemented with EndoScope. We show results from using our profiler on a collection of real-world programs, including a TPC-C implementation using the Derby database and the petstore application running on top of Tomcat application server. Our results show the benefit of our optimization framework and demonstrate that our declarative, acquisitional approach can yield program instrumentation overheads that are dramatically lower than conventional profiling tools (for example, when profiling the Derby Database running TPC-C, our system's overhead ranges from 1% to about 25%, whereas the fastest existing profiler we measured imposes a minimum overhead of about 30%.)

    :abstractText: Our previous work has shown that architectural and application shifts have resulted in modern OLTP databases increasingly falling short of optimal performance [10]. In particular, the availability of multiple-cores, the abundance of main memory, the lack of user stalls, and the dominant use of stored procedures are factors that portend a clean-slate redesign of RDBMSs. This previous work showed that such a redesign has the potential to outperform legacy OLTP databases by a significant factor. These results, however, were obtained using a bare-bones prototype that was developed just to demonstrate the potential of such a system. We have since set out to design a more complete execution platform, and to implement some of the ideas presented in the original paper. Our demonstration presented here provides insight on the development of a distributed main memory OLTP database and allows for the further study of the challenges inherent in this operating environment.

    :abstractText: There is currently considerable enthusiasm around the MapReduce (MR) paradigm for large-scale data analysis [17]. Although the basic control flow of this framework has existed in parallel SQL database management systems (DBMS) for over 20 years, some have called MR a dramatically new computing model [8, 17]. In this paper, we describe and compare both paradigms. Furthermore, we evaluate both kinds of systems in terms of performance and development complexity. To this end, we define a benchmark consisting of a collection of tasks that we have run on an open source version of MR as well as on two parallel DBMSs. For each task, we measure each system's performance for various degrees of parallelism on a cluster of 100 nodes. Our results reveal some interesting trade-offs. Although the process to load data into and tune the execution of parallel DBMSs took much longer than the MR system, the observed performance of these DBMSs was strikingly better. We speculate about the causes of the dramatic performance difference and consider implementation concepts that future systems should take from both kinds of architectures.

    :abstractText: Uncertain data arises in a number of domains, including data integration and sensor networks. Top-k queries that rank results according to some user-defined score are an important tool for exploring large uncertain data sets. As several recent papers have observed, the semantics of top-k queries on uncertain data can be ambiguous due to tradeoffs between reporting high-scoring tuples and tuples with a high probability of being in the resulting data set. In this paper, we demonstrate the need to present the score distribution of top-k vectors to allow the user to choose between results along this score-probability dimensions. One option would be to display the complete distribution of all potential top-k tuple vectors, but this set is too large to compute. Instead, we propose to provide a number of typical vectors that effectively sample this distribution. We propose efficient algorithms to compute these vectors. We also extend the semantics and algorithms to the scenario of score ties, which is not dealt with in the previous work in the area. Our work includes a systematic empirical study on both real dataset and synthetic datasets.

    :abstractText: Composite (or Complex) event processing (CEP) systems search sequences of incoming events for occurrences of user-specified event patterns. Recently, they have gained more attention in a variety of areas due to their powerful and expressive query language and performance potential. Sequentiality (temporal ordering) is the primary way in which CEP systems relate events to each other. In this paper, we present a CEP system called ZStream to efficiently process such sequential patterns. Besides simple sequential patterns, ZStream is also able to detect other patterns, including conjunction, disjunction, negation and Kleene closure. Unlike most recently proposed CEP systems, which use non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) to detect patterns, ZStream uses tree-based query plans for both the logical and physical representation of query patterns. By carefully designing the underlying infrastructure and algorithms, ZStream is able to unify the evaluation of sequence, conjunction, disjunction, negation, and Kleene closure as variants of the join operator. Under this framework, a single pattern in ZStream may have several equivalent physical tree plans, with different evaluation costs. We propose a cost model to estimate the computation costs of a plan. We show that our cost model can accurately capture the actual runtime behavior of a plan, and that choosing the optimal plan can result in a factor of four or more speedup versus an NFA based approach. Based on this cost model and using a simple set of statistics about operator selectivity and data rates, ZStream is able to adaptively and seamlessly adjust the order in which it detects patterns on the fly. Finally, we describe a dynamic programming algorithm used in our cost model to efficiently search for an optimal query plan for a given pattern.

    :abstractText: "Traffic delays and congestion are a major source of inefficiency, wasted fuel, and commuter frustration. Measuring and localizing these delays, and routing users around them, is an important step towards reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. As others have noted, the proliferation of commodity smartphones that can provide location estimates using a variety of sensors---GPS, WiFi, and/or cellular triangulation---opens up the attractive possibility of using position samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays at a fine spatiotemporal granularity. This paper presents VTrack, a system for travel time estimation using this sensor data that addresses two key challenges: energy consumption and sensor unreliability. While GPS provides highly accurate location estimates, it has several limitations: some phones don't have GPS at all, the GPS sensor doesn't work in \"urban canyons\" (tall buildings and tunnels) or when the phone is inside a pocket, and the GPS on many phones is power-hungry and drains the battery quickly. In these cases, VTrack can use alternative, less energy-hungry but noisier sensors like WiFi to estimate both a user's trajectory and travel time along the route. VTrack uses a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based map matching scheme and travel time estimation method that interpolates sparse data to identify the most probable road segments driven by the user and to attribute travel times to those segments. We present experimental results from real drive data and WiFi access point sightings gathered from a deployment on several cars. We show that VTrack can tolerate significant noise and outages in these location estimates, and still successfully identify delay-prone segments, and provide accurate enough delays for delay-aware routing algorithms. We also study the best sampling strategies for WiFi and GPS sensors for different energy cost regimes."

    :abstractText: The proliferation of GPS devices has led to a substantial interest in location based services. In particular, modern vehicles can generate an incredible amount of drive data. However, current storage systems are not optimized for storing and querying such large spatial-temporal data sets. In this demonstration, we show the performance of the TrajStore system, a dynamic storage system optimized for quickly accessing data in a particular spatial-temporal region. In particular, TrajStore uses a novel adaptive indexing technique that dynamically adjusts itself to co-locate spatially close trajectories on disk, as well as a number of compression techniques in the storage layer that significantly reduce access time for a given index cell. In this demonstration, we will store a set of real world taxi cab drive traces in TrajStore, and users will be able to query the data through a map based interface.

These included a nested-array data model, science-specific operations such as regrid, and support for uncertainty, lineage, and named versions. In this paper, we present an overview of SciDB's key features and outline a demonstration of the first version of SciDB on data and operations from one of our lighthouse users, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).

    :abstractText: In relational query processing, there are generally two choices for access paths when performing a predicate lookup for which no clustered index is available. One option is to use an unclustered index. Another is to perform a complete sequential scan of the table. Many analytical workloads do not benefit from the availability of unclustered indexes; the cost of random disk I/O becomes prohibitive for all but the most selective queries. It has been observed that a secondary index on an unclustered attribute can perform well under certain conditions if the unclustered attribute is correlated with a clustered index attribute [4]. The clustered index will co-locate values and the correlation will localize access through the unclustered attribute to a subset of the pages. In this paper, we show that in a real application (SDSS) and widely used benchmark (TPC-H), there exist many cases of attribute correlation that can be exploited to accelerate queries. We also discuss a tool that can automatically suggest useful pairs of correlated attributes. It does so using an analytical cost model that we developed, which is novel in its awareness of the effects of clustering and correlation. Furthermore, we propose a data structure called a Correlation Map (CM) that expresses the mapping between the correlated attributes, acting much like a secondary index. The paper also discusses how bucketing on the domains of both attributes in the correlated attribute pair can dramatically reduce the size of the CM to be potentially orders of magnitude smaller than that of a secondary B+Tree index. This reduction in size allows us to create a large number of CMs that improve performance for a wide range of queries. The small size also reduces maintenance costs as we demonstrate experimentally.

    :abstractText: The ability to partition sensor network application code across sensor nodes and backend servers is important for running complex, data-intensive applications on sensor platforms that have CPU, energy, and bandwidth limitations. This paper presents Wishbone, a system that takes a dataflow graph of operators and produces an optimal partitioning. With Wishbone, users can run the same program on a range of sensor platforms, including TinyOS motes, smartphones running JavaME, and the iPhone. The resulting program partitioning will in general be different in each case, reflecting the different node capabilities. Wishbone uses profiling to determine how each operator in the dataflow graph will actually perform on sample data, without requiring cumbersome user annotations. Its partitioning algorithm models the problem as an integer linear program that minimizes a linear combination of network bandwidth and CPU load and uses program structure to solve the problem efficiently in practice. Our results on a speech detection application show that the system can quickly identify good trade-offs given limitations in CPU and network capacity.

    :abstractText: Database partitioning is a technique for improving the performance of distributed OLTP databases, since "single partition" transactions that access data on one partition do not need coordination with other partitions. For workloads that are amenable to partitioning, some argue that transactions should be executed serially on each partition without any concurrency at all. This strategy makes sense for a main memory database where there are no disk or user stalls, since the CPU can be fully utilized and the overhead of traditional concurrency control, such as two-phase locking, can be avoided. Unfortunately, many OLTP applications have some transactions which access multiple partitions. This introduces network stalls in order to coordinate distributed transactions, which will limit the performance of a database that does not allow concurrency. In this paper, we compare two low overhead concurrency control schemes that allow partitions to work on other transactions during network stalls, yet have little cost in the common case when concurrency is not needed. The first is a light-weight locking scheme, and the second is an even lighter-weight type of speculative concurrency control that avoids the overhead of tracking reads and writes, but sometimes performs work that eventually must be undone. We quantify the range of workloads over which each technique is beneficial, showing that speculative concurrency control generally outperforms locking as long as there are few aborts or few distributed transactions that involve multiple rounds of communication. On a modified TPC-C benchmark, speculative concurrency control can improve throughput relative to the other schemes by up to a factor of two.

    :abstractText: We introduce a client-server toolkit called Sync Kit that demonstrates how client-side database storage can improve the performance of data intensive websites. Sync Kit is designed to make use of the embedded relational database defined in the upcoming HTML5 standard to offload some data storage and processing from a web server onto the web browsers to which it serves content. Our toolkit provides various strategies for synchronizing relational database tables between the browser and the web server, along with a client-side template library so that portions web applications may be executed client-side. Unlike prior work in this area, Sync Kit persists both templates and data in the browser across web sessions, increasing the number of concurrent connections a server can handle by up to a factor of four versus that of a traditional server-only web stack and a factor of three versus a recent template caching approach.

    :abstractText: We provide a framework to exploit dependencies among arms in multi-armed bandit problems, when the dependencies are in the form of a generative model on clusters of arms. We find an optimal MDP-based policy for the discounted reward case, and also give an approximation of it with formal error guarantee. We discuss lower bounds on regret in the undiscounted reward scenario, and propose a general two-level bandit policy for it. We propose three different instantiations of our general policy and provide theoretical justifications of how the regret of the instantiated policies depend on the characteristics of the clusters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our policies on large-scale real-world and synthetic data, and show that they significantly outperform classical policies designed for bandits with independent arms.

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of clustering data over time. An evolutionary clustering should simultaneously optimize two potentially conflicting criteria: first, the clustering at any point in time should remain faithful to the current data as much as possible; and second, the clustering should not shift dramatically from one timestep to the next. We present a generic framework for this problem, and discuss evolutionary versions of two widely-used clustering algorithms within this framework: k-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We extensively evaluate these algorithms on real data sets and show that our algorithms can simultaneously attain both high accuracy in capturing today's data, and high fidelity in reflecting yesterday's clustering."

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of estimating occurrence rates of rare eventsfor extremely sparse data, using pre-existing hierarchies to perform inference at multiple resolutions. In particular, we focus on the problem of estimating click rates for (webpage, advertisement) pairs (called impressions) where both the pages and the ads are classified into hierarchies that capture broad contextual information at different levels of granularity. Typically the click rates are low and the coverage of the hierarchies is sparse. To overcome these difficulties we devise a sampling method whereby we analyze aspecially chosen sample of pages in the training set, and then estimate click rates using a two-stage model. The first stage imputes the number of (webpage, ad) pairs at all resolutions of the hierarchy to adjust for the sampling bias. The second stage estimates clickrates at all resolutions after incorporating correlations among sibling nodes through a tree-structured Markov model. Both models are scalable and suited to large scale data mining applications. On a real-world dataset consisting of 1/2 billion impressions, we demonstrate that even with 95% negative (non-clicked) events in the training set, our method can effectively discriminate extremely rare events in terms of their click propensity.

    :abstractText: "How can a search engine automatically provide the best and most appropriate title for a result URL (link-title) so that users will be persuaded to click on the URL? We consider the problem of automatically generating link-titles for URLs and propose a general statistical framework for solving this problem. The framework is based on using information from a diverse collection of sources, each of which can be thought of as contributing one or more candidate link-titles for the URL. It can also incorporate the context in which the link-title will be used, along with constraints on its length. Our framework is applicable to several scenarios: obtaining succinct titles for displaying quicklinks, obtaining titles for URLs that lack a good title, constructing succinct sitemaps, etc. Extensive experiments show that our method is very effective, producing results that are at least 20% better than non-trivial baselines."

    :abstractText: Graphs arise in numerous applications, such as the analysis of the Web, router networks, social networks, co-citation graphs, etc. Virtually all the popular methods for analyzing such graphs, for example, k-means clustering, METIS graph partitioning and SVD/PCA, require the user to specify various parameters such as the number of clusters, number of partitions and number of principal components. We propose a novel way to group nodes, using information-theoretic principles to choose both the number of such groups and the mapping from nodes to groups. Our algorithm is completely parameter-free, and also scales practically linearly with the problem size. Further, we propose novel algorithms which use this node group structure to get further insights into the data, by finding outliers and computing distances between groups. Finally, we present experiments on multiple synthetic and real-life datasets, where our methods give excellent, intuitive results.

    :abstractText: We develop a novel framework for the page-level template detection problem. Our framework is built on two main ideas. The first is theautomatic generation of training data for a classifier that, given apage, assigns a templateness score to every DOM node of the page. The second is the global smoothing of these per-node classifier scores bysolving a regularized isotonic regression problem; the latter follows from a simple yet powerful abstraction of templateness on a page. Our extensive experiments on human-labeled test data show that our approachdetects templates effectively.

    :abstractText: Contextual advertising supports much of the Web's ecosystem today. User experience and revenue (shared by the site publisher and the ad network) depend on the relevance of the displayed ads to the page content. As with other document retrieval systems, relevance is provided by scoring the match between individual ads (documents) and the content of the page where the ads are shown (query). In this paper we show how this match can be improved significantly by augmenting the ad-page scoring function with extra parameters from a logistic regression model on the words in the pages and ads. A key property of the proposed model is that it can be mapped to standard cosine similarity matching and is suitable for efficient and scalable implementation over inverted indexes. The model parameter values are learnt from logs containing ad impressions and clicks, with shrinkage estimators being used to combat sparsity. To scale our computations to train on an extremely large training corpus consisting of several gigabytes of data, we parallelize our fitting algorithm in a Hadoop framework [10]. Experimental evaluation is provided showing improved click prediction over a holdout set of impression and click events from a large scale real-world ad placement engine. Our best model achieves a 25% lift in precision relative to a traditional information retrieval model which is based on cosine similarity, for recalling 10% of the clicks in our test data.

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of segmenting a webpage into visually and semantically cohesive pieces. Our approach is based on formulating an appropriate optimization problem on weighted graphs, where the weights capture if two nodes in the DOM tree should be placed together or apart in the segmentation; we present a learning framework to learn these weights from manually labeled data in a principled manner. Our work is a significant departure from previous heuristic and rule-based solutions to the segmentation problem. The results of our empirical analysis bring out interesting aspects of our framework, including variants of the optimization problem and the role of learning.

    :abstractText: Quicklinks for a website are navigational shortcuts displayed below the website homepage on a search results page, and that let the users directly jump to selected points inside the website. Since the real-estate on a search results page is constrained and valuable, picking the best set of quicklinks to maximize the benefits for a majority of the users becomes an important problem for search engines. Using user browsing trails obtained from browser toolbars, and a simple probabilistic model, we formulate the quicklink selection problem as a combinatorial optimizaton problem. We first demonstrate the hardness of the objective, and then propose an algorithm that is provably within a factor of 1-1/e of the optimal. We also propose a different algorithm that works on trees and that can find the optimal solution; unlike the previous algorithm, this algorithm can incorporate natural constraints on the set of chosen quicklinks. The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated via empirical results on both a manually labeled set of websites and a set for which quicklink click-through rates for several webpages were obtained from a real-world search engine.

    :abstractText: "Search queries are typically very short, which means they are often underspecified or have senses that the user did not think of. A broad latent query aspect is a set of keywords that succinctly represents one particular sense, or one particular information need, that can aid users in reformulating such queries. We extract such broad latent aspects from query reformulations found in historical search session logs. We propose a framework under which the problem of extracting such broad latent aspects reduces to that of optimizing a formal objective function under constraints on the total number of aspects the system can store, and the number of aspects that can be shown in response to any given query. We present algorithms to find a good set of aspects, and also to pick the best k aspects matching any query. Empirical results on real-world search engine logs show significant gains over a strong baseline that uses single-keyword reformulations: a gain of 14% and 23% in terms of human-judged accuracy and click-through data respectively, and around 20% in terms of consistency among aspects predicted for \"similar\" queries. This demonstrates both the importance of broad query aspects, and the efficacy of our algorithms for extracting them."

    :abstractText: An unsupervised clustering of the webpages on a website is a primary requirement for most wrapper induction and automated data extraction methods. Since page content can vary drastically across pages of one cluster (e.g., all product pages on amazon.com), traditional clustering methods typically use some distance function between the DOM trees representing a pair of webpages. However, without knowing which portions of the DOM tree are "important," such distance functions might discriminate between similar pages based on trivial features (e.g., differing number of reviews on two product pages), or club together distinct types of pages based on superficial features present in the DOM trees of both (e.g., matching footer/copyright), leading to poor clustering performance. We propose using search logs to automatically find paths in the DOM trees that mark out important portions of pages, e.g., the product title in a product page. Such paths are identified via a global analysis of the entire website, whereby search data for popular pages can be used to infer good paths even for other pages that receive little or no search traffic. The webpages on the website are then clustered using these "key" paths. Our algorithm only requires information on search queries, and the webpages clicked in response to them; there is no need for human input, and it does not need to be told which portion of a webpage the user found interesting. The resulting clusterings achieve an adjusted RAND score of over 0.9 on half of the websites (a score of 1 indicating a perfect clustering), and 59% better scores on average than competing algorithms. Besides leading to refined clusterings, these key paths can be useful in the wrapper induction process itself, as shown by the high degree of match between the key paths and the manually identified paths used in existing wrappers for these sites (90% average precision).

    :abstractText: Cluster-based and iSCSI-based storage systems rely on standard TCP/IP-over-Ethernet for client access to data. Unfortunately, when data is striped over multiple networked storage nodes, a client can experience a TCP throughput collapse that results in much lower read bandwidth than should be provided by the available network links. Conceptually, this problem arises because the client simultaneously reads fragments of a data block from multiple sources that together send enough data to overload the switch buffers on the client's link. This paper analyzes this Incast problem, explores its sensitivity to various system parameters, and examines the effectiveness of alternative TCP- and Ethernet-level strategies in mitigating the TCP throughput collapse.

    :abstractText: The emergence of the global Internet has dramatically broadened and changed the computing landscape. In particular, much of the value in contemporary computing systems derives from networked applications. Prominent examples include e-mail, Usenet news, the World Wide Web, and the many varieties of peer-to-peer networks. However, the number of successful, large-scale, truly distributed, applications is exceedingly small. We argue that a major reason for this is that tools and other facilities available to aid the developers of these applications are inadequate. We propose a life-cycle for these applications, identify challenges that must be met to make the model viable, and detail our initial work towards meeting these challenges.

    :abstractText: "Several recent proposals for sharing congestion information across concurrent flows between end-systems overlook an important problem: two or more flows sharing congestion state may infact not share the same bottleneck. In this paper, we categorize the origins of this false sharing into two distinct cases: (i) networks with QoS enhancements such as differentiated services, where a flow classifier segregates flows into different queues, and (ii) networks with path diversity where different flows to the same destination address are routed differently. We evaluate the impact of false sharing on flow performance and investigate how false sharing can be detected by a sender. We discuss how a sender must respond upon detecting false sharing. Our results show that persistent overload can be avoided with window-based congestion control even for extreme false sharing, but higher bandwidth flows run at a slower rate. We find that delay and reordering statistics can be used to develop robust detectors of false sharing and are superior to those based on loss patterns. We also find that it is markedlyeasier to detect and react to false sharing than it is to start by isolating flows and merge their congestion state afterward."

    :abstractText: Conventional wisdom has been that the performance limitations in the current Internet lie at the edges of the network -- i.e last mile connectivity to users, or access links of stub ASes. As these links are upgraded, however, it is important to consider where new bottlenecks and hot-spots are likely to arise. In this paper, we address this question through an investigation of non-access bottlenecks. These are links within carrier ISPs or between neighboring carriers that could potentially constrain the bandwidth available to long-lived TCP flows. Through an extensive measurement study, we discover, classify, and characterize bottleneck links (primarily in the U.S.) in terms of their location, latency, and available capacity.We find that about 50% of the Internet paths explored have a non-access bottleneck with available capacity less than 50 Mbps, many of which limit the performance of well-connected nodes on the Internet today. Surprisingly, the bottlenecks identified are roughly equally split between intra-ISP links and peering links between ISPs. Also, we find that low-latency links, both intra-ISP and peering, have a significant likelihood of constraining available bandwidth. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on related issues such as choosing an access provider and optimizing routes through the network. We believe that these results could be valuable in guiding the design of future network services, such as overlay routing, in terms of which links or paths to avoid (and how to avoid them) in order to improve performance.

    :abstractText: "For the last few years, large Web content providers interested in improving their scalability and availability have increasingly turned to three techniques: mirroring, content distribution, and ISP multihoming. The Domain Name System (DNS) has gained a prominent role in the way each of these techniques directs client requests to achieve the goals of scalability and availability. The DNS is thought to offer the transparent and agile control necessary to react quickly to ISP link failures or phenomenon such as flash crowds. In this paper, we investigate this assumption with the objective of quantifying the degree of responsiveness that can be expected from DNS. We use a combination of Web and DNS access measurements from several busy Web sites, as well as a large content distribution network, to characterize the behavior of end-systems and local DNS servers in terms of their adherence to DNS-based controls. Our results suggest that DNS is at best a coarse-grained mechanism, and poorly suited for applications, such as route control, which require quick response to link failures or performance degradations. We then propose several proactive techniques that, when deployed in cooperation between large content providers and important clients, have the potential to improve the responsiveness of DNS-based control."

    :abstractText: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical part of the Internet's infrastructure, and is one of the few examples of a robust, highly-scalable, and operational distributed system. Although a few studies have been devoted to characterizing its properties, such as its workload and the stability of the top-level servers, many key components of DNS have not yet been examined. Based on large-scale measurements taken fromservers in a large content distribution network, we present a detailed study of key characteristics of the DNS infrastructure, such as load distribution, availability, and deployment patterns of DNS servers. Our analysis includes both local DNS servers and servers in the authoritative hierarchy. We find that (1) the vast majority of users use a small fraction of deployed name servers, (2) the availability of most name servers is high, and (3) there exists a larger degree of diversity in local DNS server deployment and usage than for authoritative servers. Furthermore, we use our DNS measurements to draw conclusions about federated infrastructures in general. We evaluate and discuss the impact of federated deployment models on future systems, such as Distributed Hash Tables.

    :abstractText: Residential Internet connectivity is growing at a phenomenal rate. A number of recent studies have attempted to characterize this connectivity - measuring coverage and performance of last-mile broadband links - from a various vantage points on the Internet, via wireless APs, and even with user cooperation. These studies, however, sacrifice accuracy or require substantial human time. In this work, we present a novel two-pass method to characterize neighborhood networks. We demonstrate that the two pass method dramatically reduces the time spent in active measurement while retaining accuracy. A case study on two neighborhoods in Pittsburgh provide new and accurate insights into broadband connectivity, including throughput, broadband coverage (DSL vs. cable vs. fiber), NAT configurations, DHCP, DNS usage. The results further characterize 802.11 connectivity in the neighborhood.

    :abstractText: In 1989, the RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) group at U. C. Berkeley built a prototype disk array called RAID-I. The bandwidth delivered to clients by RAID-I was severely limited by the memory system bandwidth of the disk array' s host workstation. We designed our second prototype, RAID-H, to deliver more of the disk array bandwidth to file server clients. A custom-built crossbar memory system called the XBUS board connects the disks directly to the high-speed network, allowing data for large requests to bypass the server workstation. RAID-II runs Log-Structured File System (LFS) software to optimize performance for bandwidth-intensive applications.The RAID-II hardware with a single XBUS controller board delivers 20 megabytes/second for large, random read operations and up to 31 megabytes/second for sequential read operations. A preliminary implementation of LFS on RAID-II delivers 21 megabytes/second on large read requests and 15 megabytes/second on large write operations.

    :abstractText: "Over the past few years, wireless networking technologies have made vast forays into our daily lives. Today, one can find 802.11 hardware and other personal wireless technology employed at homes, shopping malls, coffee shops and airports. Present-day wireless network deployments bear two important properties: they are unplanned, with most access points (APs) deployed by users in a spontaneous manner, resulting in highly variable AP densities; and they are unmanaged, since manually configuring and managing a wireless network is very complicated. We refer to such wireless deployments as being chaotic.In this paper, we present a study of the impact of interference in chaotic 802.11 deployments on end-client performance. First, using large-scale measurement data from several cities, we show that it is not uncommon to have tens of APs deployed in close proximity of each other. Moreover, most APs are not configured to minimize interference with their neighbors. We then perform trace-driven simulations to show that the performance of end-clients could suffer significantly in chaotic deployments. We argue that end-client experience could be significantly improved by making chaotic wireless networks self-managing. We design and evaluate automated power control and rate adaptation algorithms to minimize interference among neighboring APs, while ensuring robust end-client performance."

    :abstractText: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well in traditional networks made up of links with low bit-error rates. Networks with higher bit-error rates, such as those with wireless links and mobile hosts, violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In tbis paper, we describe the design and implementation of a simple protocol, called the snoop protocol, that improves TCP performance in wireless networks. The protocol modifies network-layer software mainly at a base station and preserves end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea of the protocol is to cache packets at the base station and perform local retransmissions across the wireless link. We have implemented the snoop protocol on a wireless testbed consisting of IBM ThinkPad laptops and i486 base stations communicating over an AT&T Wavelan. Our experiments show that it is significantly more robust at dealing with unreliable wireless links as compared to normal TCP; we have achieved throughput speedups of up to 20 times over regular TCP in our experiments with the protocol.

    :abstractText: Compressing protocol headers has traditionally been an attractive way of conserving bandwidth over low-speed links, including those in wireless systems. However, despite the growth in recent years in the number of end-to-end protocols beyond TCP/IP, header compression deployment for those protocols has not kept pace. This is in large part due to complexities in implementation, which often requires a detailed knowledge of kernel internals, and a lack of a common way of pursuing the general problem across a variety of end-to-end protocols. To address this, rather than defining several new protocol-specific standards, we present a unified framework for header compression. This framework includes a simple, platform-independent header description language that protocol implementors can use to describe high-level header properties, and a platform-specific code generation tool that produces kernel source code automatically from this header specification. Together, the high-level description language and code generator free protocol designers from having to understand any details of the target platform, enabling them to implement header compression with relatively little effort. We analyze the performance of compression produced using this framework for TCP/IP in the Linux 2.0 kernel and demonstrate that unified, automatically-generated header compression without significant performance penalty is viable.

    :abstractText: The IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard power-saving mode (PSM) allows the network interface card (NIC) to periodically sleep between receiving data. In this paper, we show that 802.11 PSM performs poorly due to the fact that an access point is unable to adapt to the requirements of each client. Therefore, we propose a novel power saving algorithm, named Dynamic Beacon Period, where the access point uses different beacon periods for different clients. During HTTP downloads, each client carefully chooses a good beacon period for itself, based on the RTT of its current connections, and informs the access point of this beacon period. This technique enables download times for Web pages that are comparable to those without any power-saving and provides energy savings comparable to the standard 802.11 PSM. We show, using real-world measurements and emulation-based experiments, that it is feasible for both clients and access points to efficiently support such per-client beacon periods, instead of having a common, static beacon for all clients. The solution is simple enough that it can be implemented with just small enhancements to the existing 802.11 specification.

    :abstractText: The ubiquity of 802.11 devices and networks enables anyone to track our every move with alarming ease. Each 802.11 device transmits a globally unique and persistent MAC address and thus is trivially identifiable. In response, recent research has proposed replacing such identifiers with pseudonyms (i.e., temporary, unlinkable names). In this paper, we demonstrate that pseudonyms are insufficient to prevent tracking of 802.11 devices because implicit identifiers, or identifying characteristics of 802.11 traffic, can identify many users with high accuracy. For example, even without unique names and addresses, we estimate that an adversary can identify 64% of users with 90% accuracy when they spend a day at a busy hot spot. We present an automated procedure based on four previously unrecognized implicit identifiers that can identify users in three real 802.11 traces even when pseudonyms and encryption are employed. We find that the majority of users can be identified using our techniques, but our ability to identify users is not uniform; some users are not easily identifiable. Nonetheless, we show that even a single implicit identifier is sufficient to distinguish many users. Therefore, we argue that design considerations beyond eliminating explicit identifiers (i.e., unique names and addresses), must be addressed in order to prevent user tracking in wireless networks.

    :abstractText: We present the design and evaluation of an 802.11-like wireless link layer protocol that obfuscates all transmitted bits to increase privacy. This includes explicit identifiers such as MAC addresses, the contents of management messages, and other protocol fields that the existing 802.11 protocol relies on to be sent in the clear. By obscuring these fields, we greatly increase the difficulty of identifying or profiling users from their transmissions in ways that are otherwise straightforward. Our design, called SlyFi, is nearly as efficient as existing schemes such as WPA for discovery, link setup, and data delivery despite its heightened protections; transmission requires only symmetric key encryption and reception requires a table lookup followed by symmetric key decryption. Experiments using our implementation on Atheros 802.11 drivers show that SlyFi can discover and associate with networks faster than 802.11 using WPA-PSK. The overhead SlyFi introduces in packet delivery is only slightly higher than that added by WPA-CCMP encryption (10% vs. 3% decrease in throughput).

In this paper, we argue that the communication between components of a game can be modeled as a publish-subscribe system. We present the design of MERCURY, a completely distributed publish-subscribe system, which supports a content-based publish-subscribe model of communication and performs distributed matching using a novel content-based routing protocol. We also present preliminary simulation results identifying key design decisions affecting the scalability and network efficiency of the system.

    :abstractText: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Colyseus, a distributed architecture for interactive multiplayer games. Colyseus takes advantage of a game's tolerance for weakly consistent state and predictable workload to meet the tight latency constraints of game-play and maintain scalable communication costs. In addition, it provides a rich distributed query interface and effective prefetching subsystem to help locate and replicate objects before they are accessed at a node. We have implemented Colyseus and modified Quake II, a popular first person shooter game, to use it. Our measurements of Quake II and our own Colyseus-based game with hundreds of players shows that Colyseus effectively distributes game traffic across the participating nodes, allowing Colyseus to support low-latency game-play for an order of magnitude more players than existing single server designs, with similar per-node bandwidth costs.

    :abstractText: This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of an operating system module, the Congestion Manager (CM), which provides integrated network flow management and exports a convenient programming interface that allows applications to be notified of, and adapt to, changing network conditions. We describe the API by which applications interface with the CM, and the architectural considerations that factored into the design. To evaluate the architecture and API, we describe our implementations of TCP; a streaming layered audio/video application; and an interactive audio application using the CM, and show that they achieve adaptive behavior without incurring much end-system overhead. All flows including TCP benefit from the sharing of congestion information, and applications are able to incorporate new functionality such as congestion control and adaptive behavior.

    :abstractText: Many previous studies have examined the placement of access points (APs) to improve the community's understanding of the deployment and behavioral characteristics of wireless networks. A key implicit assumption in these studies is that one can estimate the AP location accurately from wardriving-like measurements. However, existing localization algorithms exhibit high error because they over-simplify the complex nature of signal propagation. In this work, we propose a novel approach that localizes APs using directional information derived from local signal strength variations. Our algorithm only uses signal strength information, and improves localization accuracy over existing techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust to the sampling biases and non-uniform shadowing, which are common in wardriving measurements.

    :abstractText: We present a means of containing Wi-Fi coverage to physical boundaries that are meaningful to users. We call it geo-fencing. Our approach is based on directional antennas, and our motivation is to provide wireless access and privacy models that are a natural fit with user expectations. To evaluate geo-fencing, we use measurements from an indoor testbed of Wi-Fi nodes and APs with electronically-steerable directional antennas. We find that by combining directionality, power control and coding across multiple APs, we are able to successfully confine Wi-Fi coverage to clients located within target regions of varying shapes and sizes; we can select between nodes located as close as five feet from each other.

    :abstractText: As the Internet grows in size, it becomes crucial to understand how the speeds of links in the network must improve in order to sustain the pressure of new end-nodes being added each day. Although the speeds of links in the core and at the edges roughly improve according to Moore's law, this improvement alone might not be enough. Indeed, the structure of the Internet graph and routing in the network might necessitate much faster improvements in the speeds of key links in the network.In this paper, using a combination of analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the worst congestion in the Internet in fact scales poorly with the network size (n1+&Omega;(1), where n is the number of nodes), when shortest-path routing is used. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that policy-based routing does not exacerbate the maximum congestion when compared to shortest-path routing.Our results show that it is crucial to identify ways to alleviate this congestion to avoid some links from being perpetually congested. To this end, we show that the congestion scaling properties of the Internet graph can be improved dramatically by introducing moderate amounts of redundancy in the graph in terms of parallel edges between pairs of adjacent nodes.

    :abstractText: Bluetooth, a recent innovation in short-range radio technology, has gone through the first stage of standardization, and commercial products based on v1.0 specifications will be appearing soon. While much work has gone into developing the radio technology and hardware for this system, little effort has been focused on additional infrastructure that is necessary for applications in this environment. In this paper, we examine the issue of supporting ubiquitous computing applications [21, 14] in a Bluetooth network. The Bluetooth standard defines a multi-hop routing structure, called a scatternet, to address the limitations caused by short-range and small fanout of the underlying link technology. We identify several characteristics, the combination of which makes scatternets different from previously considered networks. Importantly, Bluetooth links are connection-oriented with low-power link modes. We show that the unique aspects of the technology require a redesign of the protocol structure for link formation, IP routing, and service discovery. When existing approaches to these protocols are applied to scatternets, the multiple protocol layers would operate without knowledge of each other, resulting in inefficient use of power in many cases. We suggest an alternative approach where there is a single protocol layer providing a level of indirection within the scope of a scatternet. That is, we argue for extensive cross-layer optimizations. Specifically, this allows (a) links to be kept active only when absolutely required, and (b) scatternet-wide floods to be minimized by caching service discovery results at all intermediate nodes. Our experiments with an implementation of an emulated Bluetooth scatternet show that this could be more efficient than the traditional approach of layered protocol design.

    :abstractText: "Multihoming has traditionally been employed by stub networks to enhance the reliability of their network connectivity. With the advent of commercial \"intelligent route control\" products, stubs now leverage multihoming to improve performance. Although multihoming is widely used for reliability and, increasingly for performance, not much is known about the tangible benefits that multihoming can offer, or how these benefits can be fully exploited. In this paper, we aim to quantify the extent to which multihomed networks can leverage performance and reliability benefits from connections to multiple providers. We use data collected from servers belonging to the Akamai content distribution network to evaluate performance benefits from two distinct perspectives of multihoming: high-volume content-providers which transmit large volumes of data to many distributed clients, and enterprises which primarily receive data from the network. In both cases, we find that multihoming can improve performance significantly and that not choosing the right set of providers could result in a performance penalty as high as 40%. We also find evidence of diminishing returns in performance when more than four providers are considered for multihoming. In addition, using a large collection of measurements, we provide an analysis of the reliability benefits of multihoming. Finally, we provide guidelines on how multihomed networks can choose ISPs, and discuss practical strategies of using multiple upstream connections to achieve optimal performance benefits."

    :abstractText: The limitations of BGP routing in the Internet are often blamed for poor end-to-end performance and prolonged connectivity interruptions. Recent work advocates using overlays to effectively bypass BGP's path selection in order to improve performance and fault tolerance. In this paper, we explore the possibility that intelligent control of BGP routes, coupled with ISP multihoming, can provide competitive end-to-end performance and reliability. Using extensive measurements of paths between nodes in a large content distribution network, we compare the relative benefits of overlay routing and multihoming route control in terms of round-trip latency, TCP connection throughput, and path availability. We observe that the performance achieved by route control together with multihoming to three ISPs (3-multihoming), is within 5-15% of overlay routing employed in conjunction 3-multihoming, in terms of both end-to-end RTT and throughput. We also show that while multihoming cannot offer the nearly perfect resilience of overlays, it can eliminate almost all failures experienced by a singly-homed end-network. Our results demonstrate that, by leveraging the capability of multihoming route control, it is not necessary to circumvent BGP routing to extract good wide-area performance and availability from the existing routing system.

    :abstractText: "For years, the conventional wisdom [7, 22] has been that the continued stability of the Internet depends on the widespread deployment of \"socially responsible\" congestion control. In this paper, we seek to answer the following fundamental question: If network end-points behaved in a selfish manner, would the stability of the Internet be endangered?.We evaluate the impact of greedy end-point behavior through a game-theoretic analysis of TCP. In this \"TCP Game\" each flowattempts to maximize the throughput it achieves by modifying its congestion control behavior. We use a combination of analysis and simulation to determine the Nash Equilibrium of this game. Our question then reduces to whether the network operates efficiently at these Nash equilibria.Our findings are twofold. First, in more traditional environments -- where end-points use TCP Reno-style loss recovery and routers use drop-tail queues -- the Nash Equilibria are reasonably efficient. However, when endpoints use more recent variations of TCP (e.g., SACK) and routers employ either RED or drop-tail queues, the Nash equilibria are very inefficient. This suggests that the Internet of the past could remain stable in the face of greedy end-user behavior, but the Internet of today is vulnerable to such behavior. Second, we find that restoring the efficiency of the Nash equilibria in these settings does not require heavy-weight packet scheduling techniques (e.g., Fair Queuing) but instead can be done with a very simple stateless mechanism based on CHOKe [21]."

    :abstractText: "Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also suffer from significant non-congestion-related losses due to reasons such as bit errors and handoffs. TCP responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to-end performance in wireless and lossy systems. In this paper, we compare several schemes designed to improve the performance of TCP in such networks. These schemes are classified into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where the sender is aware of the wireless link; link-layer protocols, that provide local reliability; and split-connection protocols, that break the end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for comparison.Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol with some knowledge of TCP provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and explicit loss notifications result in significant performance improvements."

    :abstractText: This paper presents a novel framework for managing network congestion from an end-to-end perspective. Our work is motivated by trends in traffic patterns that threaten the long-term stability of the Internet. These trends include the use of multiple independent concurrent flows by Web applications and the increasing use of transport protocols and applications that do not adapt to congestion. We present an end-system architecture centered around a Congestion Manager (CM) that ensures proper congestion behavior and allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion. Our framework integrates congestion management across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters and exposes an API to enable applications to learn about network characteristics, pass information to the CM, and schedule data transmissions. Internally, it uses a window-based control algorithm, a scheduler to regulate transmissions, and a lightweight protocol to elicit feedback from receivers.We describe how TCP and an adaptive real-time streaming audio application can be implemented using the CM. Our simulation results show that an ensemble of concurrent TCP connections can effectively share bandwidth and obtain consistent performance, without adversely affecting other network flows. Our results also show that the CM enables audio applications to adapt to congestion conditions without having to perform congestion control or bandwidth probing on their own. We conclude that the CM provides a useful and pragmatic framework for building adaptive Internet applications.

Mercury differs from previous range-based query systems in that it supports multiple attributes as well as performs explicit load balancing. To guarantee efficient routing and load balancing, Mercury uses novel light-weight sampling mechanisms for uniformly sampling random nodes in a highly dynamic overlay network. Our evaluation shows that Mercury is able to achieve its goals of logarithmic-hop routing and near-uniform load balancing.We also show that Mercury can be used to solve a key problem for an important class of distributed applications: distributed state maintenance for distributed games.

    :abstractText: "In response to the serious scalability and deployment concerns with IP Multicast, we and other researchers have advocated an alternate architecture for supporting group communication applications over the Internet where all multicast functionality is pushed to the edge. We refer to such an architecture as End System Multicast. While End System Multicast has several potential advantages, a key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a design. While preliminary simulation results conducted in static environments are promising, they have yet to consider the challenging performance requirements of real world applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environment.In this paper, we explore how Internet environments and application requirements can influence End System Multicast design. We explore these issues in the context of audio and video conferencing: an important class of applications with stringent performance requirements. We conduct an extensive evaluation study of schemes for constructing overlay networks on a wide-area test-bed of about twenty hosts distributed around the Internet. Our results demonstrate that it is important to adapt to both latency and bandwidth while constructing overlays optimized for conferencing applications. Further, when relatively simple techniques are incorporated into current self-organizing protocols to enable dynamic adaptation to latency and bandwidth, the performance benefits are significant. Our results indicate that End System Multicast is a promising architecture for enabling performance-demanding conferencing applications in a dynamic and heterogeneous Internet environment."

    :abstractText: We study the impact on 802.11 networks of RF interference from devices such as Zigbee and cordless phones that increasingly crowd the 2.4GHz ISM band, and from devices such as wireless camera jammers and non-compliant 802.11 devices that seek to disrupt 802.11 operation. Our experiments show that commodity 802.11 equipment is surprisingly vulnerable to certain patterns of weak or narrow-band interference. This enables us to disrupt a link with an interfering signal whose power is 1000 times weaker than the victim's 802.11 signals, or to shut down a multiple AP, multiple channel managed network at a location with a single radio interferer. We identify several factors that lead to these vulnerabilities, ranging from MAC layer driver implementation strategies to PHY layer radio frequency implementation strategies. Our results further show that these factors are not overcome by simply changing 802.11 operational parameters (such as CCA threshold, rate and packet size) with the exception of frequency shifts. This leads us to explore rapid channel hopping as a strategy to withstand RF interference. We prototype a channel hopping design using PRISM NICs, and find that it can sustain throughput at levels of RF interference well above that needed to disrupt unmodified links, and at a reasonable cost in terms of switching overheads.

    :abstractText: Many past systems have explored how to eliminate redundant transfers from network links and improve network efficiency. Several of these systems operate at the application layer, while the more recent systems operate on individual packets. A common aspect of these systems is that they apply to localized settings, e.g. at stub network access links. In this paper, we explore the benefits of deploying packet-level redundant content elimination as a universal primitive on all Internet routers. Such a universal deployment would immediately reduce link loads everywhere. However, we argue that far more significant network-wide benefits can be derived by redesigning network routing protocols to leverage the universal deployment. We develop "redundancy-aware" intra- and inter-domain routing algorithms and show that they enable better traffic engineering, reduce link usage costs, and enhance ISPs' responsiveness to traffic variations. In particular, employing redundancy elimination approaches across redundancy-aware routes can lower intra and inter-domain link loads by 10-50%. We also address key challenges that may hinder implementation of redundancy elimination on fast routers. Our current software router implementation can run at OC48 speeds.

    :abstractText: "Without well-provisioned dedicated servers, modern fast-paced action games limit the number of players who can interact simultaneously to 16-32. This is because interacting players must frequently exchange state updates, and high player counts would exceed the bandwidth available to participating machines. In this paper, we describe Donnybrook, a system that enables epic-scale battles without dedicated server resources, even in a fast-paced game with tight latency bounds. It achieves this scalability through two novel components. First, it reduces bandwidth demand by estimating what players are paying attention to, thereby enabling it to reduce the frequency of sending less important state updates. Second, it overcomes resource and interest heterogeneity by disseminating updates via a multicast system designed for the special requirements of games: that they have multiple sources, are latency-sensitive, and have frequent group membership changes. We present user study results using a prototype implementation based on Quake III that show our approach provides a desirable user experience. We also present simulation results that demonstrate Donnybrook's efficacy in enabling battles of up to 900 players."

    :abstractText: The Internet is a very large scale, complex, dynamical system that is hard to model and analyze. In this paper, we develop and analyze statistical models for the observed end-to-end network performance based on extensive packet-level traces (consisting of approximately 1.5 billion packets) collected from the primary Web site for the Atlanta Summer Olympic Games in 1996. We find that observed mean throughputs for these transfers measured over 60 million complete connections vary widely as a function of end-host location and time of day, confirming that the Internet is characterized by a large degree of heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, we find (using best-fit linear regression techniques) that we can express the throughput for Web transfers to most hosts as a random variable with a log-normal distribution. Then, using observed throughput as the control parameter, we attempt to quantify the spatial (statistical similarity across neighboring hosts) and temporal (persistence over time) stability of network performance. We find that Internet hosts that are close to each other often have almost identically distributed probability distributions of throughput. We also find that throughputs to individual hosts often do not change appreciably for several minutes. Overall, these results indicate that there is promise in protocol mechanisms that cache and share network characteristics both within a single host and amongst nearby hosts.

    :abstractText: Performance limitations in the current Internet are thought to lie at the edges of the network -- i.e last mile connectivity to users, or access links of stub ASes. As these links are upgraded, however, it is important to consider where new bottlenecks and hot-spots are likely to arise. Through an extensive measurement study, we discover, classify and characterize non-access bottleneck links in terms of their location, latency and available capacity. We find that nearly half of the paths explored have a non-access bottleneck with available capacity less than 50 Mbps. The bottlenecks identified are roughly equally split between intra-ISP links and links between ISPs. These results have implications on issues such as the choice of access providers and route optimization.

    :abstractText: "WWW workload generators are used to evaluate web server performance, and thus have a large impact on what performance optimizations are applied to servers. However, current benchmarks ignore a crucial component: how these servers perform in the environment in which they are intended to be used, namely the wide-area Internet.This paper shows how WAN conditions can affect WWW server performance. We examine these effects using an experimental test-bed which emulates WAN characteristics in a live setting, by introducing factors such as delay and packet loss in a controlled and reproducible fashion. We study how these factors interact with the host TCP implementation and what influence they have on web server performance. We demonstrate that when more realistic wide-area conditions are introduced, servers exhibit very different performance properties and scaling behaviors, which are not exposed by existing benchmarks running on LANs. We show that observed throughputs can give misleading information about server performance, and thus find that maximum throughput, or capacity, is a more useful metric. We find that packet losses can reduce server capacity by as much as 50 percent and increase response time as seen by the client. We show that using TCP SACK can reduce client response time, without reducing server capacity."

    :abstractText: Multihoming is increasingly being employed by large enterprises and data centers as a mechanism to extract good performance from their provider connections. Today, multihomed end-networks can employ a variety of commercial route control products to optimize performance over multiple ISP links. However, little is known about the mechanisms employed by such products and their relative trade-offs. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a wide range practical schemes that could go into the design of a route control device and analyze their trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linux-based Web proxy and perform a trace-based emulation of their relative performance benefits. We show that both passive and active monitoring based techniques are equally effective and could improve Web performance by about 25% when compared to using a single provider. Another key observation is that the conventional practice of employing historical measurement samples to monitor and predict ISP performance could, in fact, result in sub-optimal performance.

    :abstractText: In the Internet today, users and applications must often make decisions based on the performance they expect to receive from other Internet hosts. For example, users can often view many Web pages in low-bandwidth or high-bandwidth versions, while other pages present users with long lists of mirror sites to chose from. Current techniques to perform these decisions are often ad hoc or poorly designed. The most common solution used today is to require the user to manually make decisions based on their own experience and whatever information is provided by the application. Previous efforts to automate this decision-making process have relied on isolated, active network probes from a host. Unfortunately, this method of making measurements has several problems. Active probing introduces unnecessary network traffic that can quickly become a significant part of the total traffic handled by busy Web servers. Probing from a single host results in less accurate information and more redundant network probes than a system that shares information with nearby hosts. In this paper, we propose a system called SPAND (Shared Passive Network Performance Discovery) that determines network characteristics by making shared, passive measurements from a collection of hosts. In this paper, we show why using passive measurements from a collection of hosts has advantages over using active measurements from a single host. We also show that sharing measurements can significantly increase the accuracy and timeliness of predictions. In addition, we present a initial prototype design of SPAND, the current implementation status of our system, and initial performance results that show the potential benefits of SPAND.

    :abstractText: As the Internet grows in size, it becomes crucial to understand how the speeds of links in the network must improve in order to sustain the pressure of new end-nodes being added each day. Although the speeds of links in the core and at the edges improve roughly according to Moore's law, this improvement alone might not be enough. Indeed, the structure of the Internet graph and routing in the network might necessitate much faster improvements in the speeds of key links in the network. In this paper, using a combination of analysis and extensive simulations, we show that the worst congestion in the Internet AS-level graph in fact scales poorly with the network size (<i>n</i><sup>1+&omega;(1)</sup>, where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes), when shortest-path routing is used to route traffic between ASes. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that policy-based routing <i>does not</i> exacerbate the maximum congestion when compared to shortest-path routing. Our results show that it is crucial to identify ways to alleviate this congestion to avoid some links from being perpetually congested. To this end, we show that the congestion scaling properties of Internet-like graphs can be improved dramatically by introducing moderate amounts of redundancy in the graph in terms of parallel edges between pairs of adjacent nodes.

    :abstractText: "Recently, several proposals have been made for sharing congestion information across concurrent flows between end-systems. In these proposals, the granularity for sharing has ranged from all flows to a common host to all hosts on a shared LAN. While these proposals have been successful at ensuring sound AIMD behavior of the aggregate of flows, they suffer from what we term \"false sharing\". False sharing occurs when two or more flows sharing congestion state may, in fact, not share the same bottleneck.In this work, we investigate the effects of false sharing on shared congestion management schemes. We characterize the origins of false sharing into two distinct cases: (i) networks with QoS enhancements such as differentiated services, where a flow classifier segregates flows into different queues, and (ii) networks with path diversity where different flows to the same destination address are routed differently --- a situation that occurs in dispersity routing, load-balancing, and with network address translators (NATs). We evaluate the impact of false sharing on flow performance and consider whether it might cause a bottleneck link to become persistently overloaded. We propose schemes for detecting false sharing and show how different metrics (loss rate, delay distribution, and reordering) compare for this purpose. We also consider the issue of how a sender should respond when it detects false sharing."

For example, rate of mobility, quality of wireless communication, density of communicating nodes, power constraints and computational constraints all vary greatly from situation to situation. Unfortunately, existing routing protocols, transport protocols and adaptive applications can only adapt in a limited way. One feature that is missing from many systems is the ability to identify gross operating conditions and take on very different modes of operation. Such adaptability would improve the efficiency of many solutions. We use the term multi-modal protocols to describe systems that adapt in this way.

Multihomed end networks today can employ a variety of route control products to optimize their Internet access performance and reliability. However, little is known about the tangible benefits that such products can offer, the mechanisms they employ and their trade-offs. This paper makes two important contributions. First, we present a study of the potential improvements in Internet round-trip times (RTTs) and transfer speeds from employing multihoming route control. Our analysis shows that multihoming to three or more ISPs and cleverly scheduling traffic across the ISPs can improve Internet RTTs and throughputs by up to 25% and 20%, respectively. However, a careful selection of ISPs is important to realize the performance improvements. Second, focusing on large enterprises, we propose and evaluate a wide-range of route control mechanisms and evaluate their design trade-offs. We implement the proposed schemes on a Linux-based Web proxy and perform a trace-based evaluation of their performance. We show that both passive and active measurement-based techniques are equally effective and could improve the Web response times of enterprise networks by up to 25% on average, compared to using a single ISP. We also outline several "best common practices" for the design of route control products.

    :abstractText: TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well in traditional networks where congestion is the primary cause of packet loss. However, networks with wireless links and mobile hosts incur significant losses due to bit-errors and hand-offs. This environment violates many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded end-to-end performance. In this paper, we describe the additions and modifications to the standard Internet protocol stack (TCP/IP) to improve end-to-end reliable transport performance in mobile environments. The protocol changes are made to network-layer software at the base station and mobile host, and preserve the end-to-end semantics of TCP. One part of the modifications, called the snoop module, caches packets at the base station and performs local retransmissions across the wireless link to alleviate the problems caused by high bit-error rates. The second part is a routing protocol that enables low-latency handoff to occur with negligible data loss. We have implemented this new protocol stack on a wireless testbed. Our experiments show that this system is significantly more robust at dealing with unreliable wireless links than normal TCP; we have achieved throughput speedups of up to 20 times over regular TCP and handoff latencies over 10 times shorter than other mobile routing protocols.

    :abstractText: "Over the past few years, wireless networking technologies have made vast forays into our daily lives. Today, one can find 802.11 hardware and other personal wireless technology employed at homes, shopping malls, coffee shops and airports. Present-day wireless network deployments bear two important properties: they are unplanned, with most access points (APs) deployed by users in a spontaneous manner, resulting in highly variable AP densities; and they are unmanaged, since manually configuring and managing a wireless network is very complicated. We refer to such wireless deployments as being chaotic. In this paper, we present a study of the impact of interference in chaotic 802.11 deployments on end-client performance. First, using large-scale measurement data from several cities, we show that it is not uncommon to have tens of APs deployed in close proximity of each other. Moreover, most APs are not configured to minimize interference with their neighbors. We then perform trace-driven simulations to show that the performance of end-clients could suffer significantly in chaotic deployments. We argue that end-client experience could be significantly improved by making chaotic wireless networks self-managing. We design and evaluate automated power control and rate adaptation algorithms to minimize interference among neighboring APs, while ensuring robust end-client performance."

Unfortunately, there is currently no way for users to determine which hotspot access points (APs) will be sufficient to run their applications before purchasing access. To address this problem, this paper presents Wifi-Reports, a collaborative service that provides Wi-Fi clients with historical information about AP performance and application support. The key research challenge in Wifi-Reports is to obtain accurate user-submitted reports. This is challenging because two conflicting goals must be addressed in a practical system: preserving the privacy of users' reports and limiting fraudulent reports. We introduce a practical cryptographic protocol that achieves both goals, and we address the important engineering challenges in building Wifi-Reports. Using a measurement study of commercial APs in Seattle, we show that Wifi-Reports would improve performance over previous AP selection approaches in 30%-60% of locations."

    :abstractText: The demand for wireless bandwidth in indoor environments such as homes and offices continues to increase rapidly. Although wireless technologies such as MIMO can reach link throughputs of 100s of Mbps (802.11n) for a single link, the question of how we can deliver high throughput to a large number of densely-packed devices remains an open problem. Directional antennas have been shown to be an effective way to increase spatial reuse, but past work has focused largely on outdoor environments where the interactions between wireless links can usually be ignored. This assumption is not acceptable in dense indoor wireless networks since indoor deployments need to deal with rich scattering and multipath effects. In this paper we introduce DIRC, a wireless network design whose access points use phased array antennas to achieve high throughput in dense, indoor environments. The core of DIRC is an algorithm that increases spatial reuse and maximizes overall network capacity by optimizing the orientations of a network of directional antennas. We implemented DIRC and evaluated it on a nine node network in an enterprise setting. Our results show that DIRC improves overall network capacity in indoor environments, while being flexible enough to adapt to node mobility and changing traffic workloads.

    :abstractText: "Asymmetric broadband connections in the home provide a limited upstream pipe to the Internet. This limitation makes various applications, such as remote backup and sharing high definition video, impractical. However, homes in a neighborhood often have high bandwidth wireless networks, whose bandwidth exceeds that of a single wired uplink. Moreover, most (wired and wireless) connections are idle most of the time. In this paper, we examine the fundamental requirements of a system that aggregates upstream broadband connections in a neighborhood using wireless communication between homes. A scheme addressing this problem must operate efficiently in an environment that is: i) highly lossy; ii) broadcast in nature; and iii) half-duplex. We propose a novel scheme, Link-alike, that addresses those three challenges using opportunistic wireless reception, a novel wireless broadcast rate control scheme, and preferential use of the wired downlink. Through analytical and experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach provides significantly better throughput than previous solutions based on TCP or UDP unicast."

    :abstractText: "Satellite operators have recently begun offering Internet access over their networks. Typically, users connect to the network using a modem for uplink, and a satellite dish for downlink. We investigate how the performance of these networks might be improved by two simple techniques: caching and use of the return path on the modem link. We examine the problem from a theoretical perspective and via simulation. We show that the general problem is NP-hard, as are several special cases, and we give approximation algorithms for them. We then use insights from these cases to design practical heuristic schedulers which leverage caching and the modem downlinks. Via simulation, we show that caching alone can simultaneously reduce bandwidth requirements by 33% and improve response times by 62%. We further show that the proposed schedulers, combined with caching, yield a system that performs far better under high loads than existing systems."

    :abstractText: Today's rich and varied wireless environment, including mobile phones, Wi-Fi-enabled laptops, and Bluetooth headsets, poses threats to our privacy that cannot be addressed with existing protocols. By considering 802.11 as a case study and analyzing publicly available 802.11 traces, we show that a device can be identified and tracked over time through its persistent link-layer address, list of known networks (SSIDs), and other protocol and physical layer characteristics. We argue that it is in the best interest of providers as well as users to design systems that maintain user privacy. We identify several research challenges to doing so and offer some direction towards a solution.

    :abstractText: "Over the past few years a range of new Media Access Control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for wireless networks. This research has been driven by the observation that a single one-size-fits-all MAC protocol cannot meet the needs of diverse wireless deployments and applications. Unfortunately, most MAC functionality has traditionally been implemented on the wireless card for performance reasons, thus, limiting the opportunities for MAC customization. Software-defined radios (SDRs) promise unprecedented flexibility, but their architecture has proven to be a challenge for MAC protocols. In this paper, we identify a minimum set of core MAC functions that must be implemented close to the radio in a high-latency SDR architecture to enable high performance and efficient MAC implementations. These functions include: precise scheduling in time, carrier sense, backoff, dependent packets, packet recognition, fine-grained radio control, and access to physical layer information. While we focus on an architecture where the bus latency exceeds common MAC interaction times (tens to hundreds of microseconds), other SDR architectures with lower latencies can also benefit from implementing a subset of these functions closer to the radio. We also define an API applicable to all SDR architectures that allows the host to control these functions, providing the necessary flexibility to implement a diverse range of MAC protocols. We show the effectiveness of our split-functionality approach through an implementation on the GNU Radio and USRP platforms. Our evaluation based on microbenchmarks and end-to-end network measurements, shows that our design can simultaneously achieve high flexibility and high performance."

    :abstractText: Multimedia content is a dominant fraction of Internet usage today. At the same time, there is significant heterogeneity in video presentation modes and operating conditions of Internet-enabled devices that access such content. Users are often interested in the content, rather than the specific sources or the formats. The host-centric format of the current Internet does not support these requirements naturally. Neither do the recent data-centric naming proposals, since they rely on naming content based on raw byte-level hashing schemes. We argue that to meet these requirements, enabling content retrieval mechanisms to name and query directly for the underlying information is a good way forward. In addition to decoupling content from available sources and transfer protocols, these "information-aware names" or InfoNames explicitly decouple the information from content presentation factors as well. We envision an InfoName Resolution System (IRS) to resolve location based on InfoNames, while taking into account the operating conditions of devices. In this demo, we present an application to show how InfoNames can serve as presentation-invariant and portable names to fetch video content independent of device capabilities and resource constraints.

    :abstractText: Networking researchers have been using tools like wireshark and tcpdump to sniff packets on physical links that use different types of datalink protocols, e.g. Ethernet or 802.11, allowing them to monitor higher level protocols sharing these links. However, monitoring wireless links is more challenging, since the transmission medium is shared by flows using diverse datalink protocols (e.g. 802.11, Bluetooth) and physical layer schemes (e.g. QPSK and GFSK). To this end, we propose RFDump, a software architecture for monitoring packets on heterogeneous wireless networks. The key idea underlying our architecture is the use of a fast detection stage which can tentatively map signals to protocols very efficiently. As a result, RFDump can scale up to a modest number (5-10) of wireless technologies. We implemented RFDump on the GNU Radio and USRP platforms. This is, to our knowledge, the first inexpensive software-based infrastructure for simultaneously analyzing multiple wireless protocols in real-time. Using traces from the real world and from a wireless emulator testbed, we show that our implementation is efficient and accurate. Further, we demonstrate that our system is extensible and scales with the addition of new protocols.

    :abstractText: "Many inference problems that arise in sensor networks require the computation of a global conclusion that is consistent with local information known to each node. A large class of these problems---including probabilistic inference, regression, and control problems---can be solved by message passing on a data structure called a junction tree. In this paper, we present a distributed architecture for solving these problems that is robust to unreliable communication and node failures. In this architecture, the nodes of the sensor network assemble themselves into a junction tree and exchange messages between neighbors to solve the inference problem efficiently and exactly. A key part of the architecture is an efficient distributed algorithm for optimizing the choice of junction tree to minimize the communication and computation required by inference. We present experimental results from a prototype implementation on a 97-node Mica2 mote network, as well as simulation results for three applications: distributed sensor calibration, optimal control, and sensor field modeling. These experiments demonstrate that our distributed architecture can solve many important inference problems exactly, efficiently, and robustly."

    :abstractText: "Summary: We introduce an algorithm that uses the information gained from simultaneous consideration of an entire group of related proteins to create multiple structure alignments (MSTAs). Consistency-based alignment (CBA) first harnesses the information contained within regions that are consistently aligned among a set of pairwise superpositions in order to realign pairs of proteins through both global and local refinement methods. It then constructs a multiple alignment that is maximally consistent with the improved pairwise alignments. We validate CBA's alignments by assessing their accuracy in regions where at least two of the aligned structures contain the same conserved sequence motif. Results: CBA correctly aligns well over 90% of motif residues in superpositions of proteins belonging to the same family or superfamily, and it outperforms a number of previously reported MSTA algorithms. Availability: CBA is available at http://cba.stanford.edu/ and the source code is freely available at http://brutlag.stanford.edu/software/ Contact: brutlag@stanford.edu Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    :abstractText: In this paper we present a second generation URL monitoring tool which enables the collaborative evaluation of URL content changes. In our implementation, a document monitoring agent works alongside a recommender system. Using information provided by the monitoring agent, the collaborative system alerts users when documents they are monitoring have changed. The monitoring agent provides automatic evaluation of the nature of the change. Users, however, add subjective evaluations; one user's effort informs all others monitoring the same URL. Based on these subjective evaluations, the collaborative system can filter the changed URLs, providing customized notifications for each user based on individual preferences. In this paper, we describe the implemented system and usage results.

    :abstractText: "This paper describes a new software agent, the community search assistant, which recommends related searches to users of search engines. The community search assistant enables communities of users to search in a collaborative fashion. All queries submitted by the community are stored in the form of a graph. Links are made between queries that are found to be related. Users can peruse the network of related queries in an ordered way: following a path from a first cousin, to a second cousin to a third cousin, etc. to a set of search results. The first key idea behind the use of query graphs is that the determination of relatedness depends on the documents returned by the queries, not on the actual terms in the queries themselves. The second key idea is that the construction of the query graph transforms single user usage of information networks (e.g. search) into collaborative usage: all users can tap into the knowledge base of queries submitted by others."

    :abstractText: "Weblogs and message boards provide online forums for discussion that record the voice of the public. Woven into this mass of discussion is a wide range of opinion and commentary about consumer products. This presents an opportunity for companies to understand and respond to the consumer by analyzing this unsolicited feedback. Given the volume, format and content of the data, the appropriate approach to understand this data is to use large-scale web and text data mining technologies.This paper argues that applications for mining large volumes of textual data for marketing intelligence should provide two key elements: a suite of powerful mining and visualization technologies and an interactive analysis environment which allows for rapid generation and testing of hypotheses. This paper presents such a system that gathers and annotates online discussion relating to consumer products using a wide variety of state-of-the-art techniques, including crawling, wrapping, search, text classification and computational linguistics. Marketing intelligence is derived through an interactive analysis framework uniquely configured to leverage the connectivity and content of annotated online discussion."

    :abstractText: "Light power is affected when it crosses the atmosphere; there is a simple, albeit non-linear, relationship between the radiance of an image at any given wavelength and the distance between object and viewer. This phenomenon is called atmospheric scattering and has been extensively studied by physicists and meterologists. We present the first analysis of this phenomenon from an image understanding perspective: we investigate a group of techniques for extraction of depth cues solely from the analysis of atmospheric scattering effects in images. Depth from scattering techniques are discussed for indoor and outdoor environments, and experimental tests with real images are presented. We have found that depth cues in outdoor scenes can be recovered with surprising accuracy and can be used as an additional information source for autonomous vehicles."

    :abstractText: This paper presents new results on the complexity of graph-theoretical models that represent probabilities (Bayesian networks) and that represent interval and set valued probabilities (credal networks). We define a new class of networks with bounded width, and introduce a new decision problem for Bayesian networks, the maximin a posteriori. We present new links between the Bayesian and credal networks, and present new results both for Bayesian networks (most probable explanation with observations, maximin a posteriori) and for credal networks (bounds on probabilities a posteriori, most probable explanation with and without observations, maximum a posteriori).

    :abstractText: "Two noteworthy models of planning in AI are probabilistic planning (based on MDPs and its generalizations) and nondeterministic planning (mainly based on model checking). In this paper we: (1) show that probabilistic and nondeterministic planning are extremes of a rich continuum of problems that deal simultaneously with risk and (Knightian) uncertainty; (2) obtain a unifying model for these problems using imprecise MDPs; (3) derive a simplified Bellman's principle of optimality for our model; and (4) show how to adapt and analyze state-of-art algorithms such as (L)RTDP and LDFS in this unifying setup. We discuss examples and connections to various proposals for planning under (general) uncertainty."

We study the mathematical properties of irrelevance and independence, and their relation to the graphoid axioms. Examples are given to show that epistemic irrelevance can violate the symmetry, contraction and intersection axioms, that epistemic independence can violate contraction and intersection, and that this accords with informal notions of irrelevance and independence.

    :abstractText: "We consider the problem of synthesizing policies, in domains where actions have probabilistic effects, that are optimal in the expected-case among the optimal worst-case strong policies. Thus we combine features from nondeterministic and probabilistic planning in a single framework. We present an algorithm that combines dynamic programming and model checking techniques to find plans satisfying the problem requirements: the strong preimage computation from model checking is used to avoid actions that lead to cycles or dead ends, reducing the model to a Markov Decision Process where all possible policies are strong and worst-case optimal (i.e., successful and minimum length with probability 1). We show that backward induction can then be used to select a policy in this reduced model. The resulting algorithm is presented in two versions (enumerative and symbolic); we show that the latter version allows planning with extended reachability goals."

    :abstractText: Automatic classification by machines is one of the basic tasks required in any pattern recognition and human computer interaction applications. In this paper, we discuss training probabilistic classifiers with labeled and unlabeled data. We provide an analysis which shows under what conditions unlabeled data can be used in learning to improve classification performance. We discuss the implications of this analysis to a specific type of probabilistic classifiers, Bayesian networks, and propose a structure learning algorithm that can utilize unlabeled data to improve classification. Finally, we show how the resulting algorithms are successfully employed in a facial expression recognition application.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces a probabilistic description logic that adds probabilistic inclusions to the popular logic $\mathcal{ALC}$, and derives inference algorithms for inference in the logic. The probabilistic logic, referred to as cr $\mathcal{ALC}$ ("credal" $\mathcal{ALC}$), combines the usual acyclicity condition with a Markov condition; in this context, inference is equated with calculation of (bounds on) posterior probability in relational credal/Bayesian networks. As exact inference does not seem scalable due to the presence of quantifiers, we present first-order loopy propagation methods that seem to behave appropriately for non-trivial domain sizes.

    :abstractText: Credal networks generalize Bayesian networks relaxing numerical parameters. This considerably expands expressivity, but makes belief updating a hard task even on polytrees. Nevertheless, if all the variables are binary, polytree-shaped credal networks can be efficiently updated by the 2U algorithm. In this paper we present a binarization algorithm, that makes it possible to approximate an updating problem in a credal net by a corresponding problem in a credal net over binary variables. The procedure leads to outer bounds for the original problem. The binarized nets are in general multiply connected, but can be updated by the loopy variant of 2U. The quality of the overall approximation is investigated by promising numerical experiments.

    :abstractText: This paper investigates Walley's concepts of epistemic irrelevance and epistemic independence for imprecise probability models. We study the mathematical properties of irrelevance and independence, and their relation to the graphoid axioms. Examples are given to show that epistemic irrelevance can violate the symmetry, contraction and intersection axioms, that epistemic independence can violate contraction and intersection, and that this accords with informal notions of irrelevance and independence.

    :abstractText: This paper describes (1) a novel, effective algorithm for outdoor visual position estimation&semi; (2) the implementation of this algorithm in the Viper system&semi; and (3) the extensive tests that have demonstrated the superior accuracy and speed of the algorithm. The Viper system (i>Visual i>Position i>Estimator for i>Rovers) is geared towards robotic space missions, and the central purpose of the system is to increase the situational awareness of a rover operator by presenting accurate position estimates. The system has been extensively tested with terrestrial and lunar imagery, in terrains ranging from moderate&mdash;the rounded hills of Pittsburgh and the high deserts of Chile&mdash;to rugged&mdash;the dramatic relief of the Apollo 17 landing site&mdash;to extreme&mdash;the jagged peaks of the Rockies. Results have consistently demonstrated that the visual estimation algorithm estimates position with an accuracy and reliability that greatly surpass previous work.

In this paper we discuss algorithms for exact and approximate inferences in credal networks. We propose a branch-and-bound framework for inference, and focus on inferences for polytree-shaped networks. We also propose a new algorithm, A/R+, for outer approximations in polytree-shaped credal networks.

    :abstractText: This paper presents a family of algorithms for approximate inference in credal networks (that is, models based on directed acyclic graphs and set-valued probabilities) that contain only binary variables. Such networks can represent incomplete or vague beliefs, lack of data, and disagreements among experts; they can also encode models based on belief functions and possibilistic measures. All algorithms for approximate inference in this paper rely on exact inferences in credal networks based on polytrees with binary variables, as these inferences have polynomial complexity. We are inspired by approximate algorithms for Bayesian networks; thus the Loopy 2U algorithm resembles Loopy Belief Propagation, while the Iterated Partial Evaluation and Structured Variational 2U algorithms are, respectively, based on Localized Partial Evaluation and variational techniques.

In this paper, we discuss training probabilistic classifiers with labeled and unlabeled data. We provide a new analysis that shows under what conditions unlabeled data can be used in learning to improve classification performance. We also show that, if the conditions are violated, using unlabeled data can be detrimental to classification performance. We discuss the implications of this analysis to a specific type of probabilistic classifiers, Bayesian networks, and propose a new structure learning algorithm that can utilize unlabeled data to improve classification. Finally, we show how the resulting algorithms are successfully employed in two applications related to human-computer interaction and pattern recognition: facial expression recognition and face detection."

    :abstractText: LandScan (LANguage Driven SCene ANalysis) is presented as an integrated vision system which covers most levels of both vision and natural language processing. Computations are both data-driven and query-driven. In the report we focus on the design of the vision and control modules. Future work will investigate in more detail the design of the natural language interface. The data-driven system employs active control of stereo cameras for image acquisition, and dynamically constructs a surface model from multiple aerial views of an urban scene. The query-driven system allows the user's natural language queries to focus analysis to pertinent regions of the scene. This is different than many image understanding systems which present a symbolic description of the entire scene regardless of what portions of that picture are actually of interest.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework in which acts of manipulation are undertaken for the sake of perceiving material. Within this framework, we disambiguate different materials by actively contacting and probing them, and by sensing the resulting forces, displacements, and sounds. We report experimental results from four separate implementations of this framework using a variety of sensory modalities, including force, vision, and audition. For each implementation, we identify sensor-derived measures that are diagnostic of material properties, and use those measures to categorize objects by their material class. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the issue of shape-in variance is of critical importance for future work.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents the results of field trials of a prototype lunar rover traveling over natural terrain under safeguarded teleoperation control. Both the rover and the safeguarding approach have been used in previous work. The original contributions of this paper are the development and integration of a laser hazard detection system, and extensive field testing of the overall system. The laser system, which complements an existing stereo vision system, is based on a line-scanning laser ranger viewing the area 1 meter in front of the rover. The laser system has demonstrated excellent performance: zero misses and few false alarms operating at 4 Hz. The overall safeguarding system guided the rover 43 km over lunar analogue terrain with 0.8 failures per kilometer."

    :abstractText: This article describes the conduct of six evaluation experiments for the Perception for Off-Road Robotics program. Key distinctions of the testing methodology include conduct of the experiments by a group independent from the developers, unrehearsed experiments that provide little advance knowledge of the test courses, and blind experiments that do not allow the system operators to see the test courses until testing has completed.The article presents quantified, objective performance metrics for the systems evaluated. The basis for evaluation is 296 runs traveling 130 km in 110 hr. The results show significant progress over the course of the program, reducing the Emergency-Stops per kilometer by a factor of 22, reducing the uplink data volume per unit distance by a factor of 46 and the downlink data volume per unit distance by a factor of 3.At the end of Phase III, typical performance in desert terrain by the most reliable system achieved travel speed of 66 cm/s covering 90% of the distance in autonomous mode.

    :abstractText: The authors are building a prototype legged rover, called the Ambler (loosely an acronym for autonomous mobile exploration robot) and testing it on full-scale, rugged terrain of the sort that might be encountered on the Martian surface. They present an overview of their research program, focusing on locomotion, perception, planning, and control. They summarize some of the most important goals and requirements of a rover design and describe how locomotion, perception, and planning systems can satisfy these requirements. Since the program is relatively young (one year old at the time of writing) they identify issues and approaches and describe work in progress rather than report results. It is expected that many of the technologies developed will be applicable to other planetary bodies and to terrestrial concerns such as hazardous waste assessment and remediation, ocean floor exploration, and mining.

    :abstractText: A method of computing absolute range from stereo disparities by using verging cameras is presented. The approach differs from others by concentrating, through both analysis and experiment, on the effects caused by convergence, rather than on the general camera calibration problem. To compute stereo disparities, linear image features are extracted and matched using a hypothesize-and-verify method. To compute range, the relationship between object distance, vergence angle, and disparity is derived. Experimental results show the precision of the range computation, excluding mistaken matches, to be approximately 5% for object distances up to three meters and a baseline distance of 13 cm. Including mistaken matches results in performance that is an order of magnitude worse, leading the authors to suggest methods to identify and model them.

    :abstractText: "Contact sounds can provide important perceptual cues in virtual environments. We investigated the relation between material perception and variables that govern the synthesis of contact sounds. A shape-invariant, auditory-decay parameter was a powerful determinant of the perceived material of an object. Subjects judged the similarity of synthesized sounds with respect to material (Experiment 1 and 2) or length (Experiment 3). The sounds corresponded to modal frequencies of clamped bars struck at an intermediate point, and they varied in fundamental frequency and frequency-dependent rate of decay. The latter parameter has been proposed as reflecting a shape-invariant material property: damping. Differences between sounds in both decay and frequency affected similarity judgments (magnitude of similarity and judgment duration), with decay playing a substantially larger role. Experiment 2, which varied the initial sound amplitude, showed that decay rate---rather than total energy or sound duration---was the critical factor in determining similarity. Experiment 3 demonstrated that similarity judgments in the first two studies were specific to instructions to judge material. Experiment 4, in which subjects assigned the sounds to one of four material categories, showed an influence of frequency and decay, but confirmed the greater importance of decay. Decay parameters associated with each category were estimated and found to correlate with physical measures of damping. The results support the use of a simplified model of material in virtual auditory environments."

    :abstractText: We consider the problem of coverage and exploration of an unknown dynamic environment using a mobile robot(s). The environment is assumed to be large enough such that constant motion by the robot(s) is needed to cover the environment. We present an efficient minimalist algorithm which assumes that global information is not available (neither a map, nor GPS). Our algorithm deploys a network of radio beacons which assists the robot(s) in coverage. This network is also used for navigation. The deployed network can also be used for applications other than coverage. Simulation experiments are presented which show the collaboration between the deployed network and mobile robot(s) for the tasks of coverage/exploration, network deployment and maintenance (repair), and mobile robot(s) recovery (homing behavior). We present a theoretical basis for our algorithm on graphs and show the results of the simulated scenario experiments.

    :abstractText: Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS) introduces a new actuation capability for embedded networked sensing. By exploiting a constrained actuation method based on rapidly deployable infrastructure, NIMS suspends a network of wireless mobile and fixed sensor nodes in three-dimensional space. This permits run-time adaptation with variable sensing location, perspective, and even sensor type. Discoveries in NIMS environmental investigations have raised requirements for 1) new embedded platforms integrating many diverse sensors with actuators, and 2) advances for in-network sensor data processing. This is addressed with a new and generally applicable processor-preprocessor architecture described in this paper. Also this paper describes the successful integration of R, a powerful statistical computing environment, into the embedded NIMS node platform.

    :abstractText: The usage of conventional assistive cane devices is critical in reducing the risk of falls, which are particularly detrimental for the elderly and disabled. Many of the individuals that experience the greatest risk of falling rely on cane devices for support of ambulation. However, the results of many studies have shown that incorrect cane usage is prevalent among cane users. The original SmartCane assistive system [4] has been developed to provide a method for acquiring detailed motion data from cane usage. The cane itself, however, lacks any type of programmability as well as real-time data processing algorithms to provide feedback to the cane user. In this demonstration, we have incorporated an embedded computing platform into SmartCane [2] and developed a real-time sensor information processing algorithm that provides direct detection of cane usage characteristics. The new system provides local data processing capability by classifying whether an individual is executing a stride with proper cane motion and applied forces. It also provides direct feedback information to the individual, thereby guiding the subject towards proper cane usage and reducing the risk of falls.

    :abstractText: Monitoring of environmental phenomena with embedded networked sensing confronts the challenges of both unpredictable variability in the spatial distribution of phenomena, coupled with demands for a high spatial sampling rate in three dimensions. For example, low distortion mapping of critical solar radiation properties in forest environments may require two-dimensional spatial sampling rates of greater than 10 samples/m2 over transects exceeding 1000 m2. Clearly, adequate sampling coverage of such a transect requires an impractically large number of sensing nodes. This paper describes a new approach where the deployment of a combination of autonomous-articulated and static sensor nodes enables sufficient spatiotemporal sampling densityo ver large transects to meet a general set of environmental mapping demands. To achieve this we have developed an embedded networked sensor architecture that merges sensing and articulation with adaptive algorithms that are responsive to both variabilityin environmental phenomena discovered bythe mobile sensors and to discrete events discovered byst atic sensors. We begin byde scribing the class of important driving applications, the statistical foundations for this new approach, and task allocation. We then describe our experimental implementation of adaptive, event aware, exploration algorithms, which exploit our wireless, articulated sensors operating with deterministic motion over large areas. Results of experimental measurements and the relationship among sampling methods, event arrival rate, and sampling performance are presented.

    :abstractText: "Objective: Presented work highlights the development and initial validation of a medical embedded device for individualized care (MEDIC), which is based on a novel software architecture, enabling sensor management and disease prediction capabilities, and commercially available microelectronic components, sensors and conventional personal digital assistant (PDA) (or a cell phone). Methods and materials: In this paper, we present a general architecture for a wearable sensor system that can be customized to an individual patient's needs. This architecture is based on embedded artificial intelligence that permits autonomous operation, sensor management and inference, and may be applied to a general purpose wearable medical diagnostics. Results: A prototype of the system has been developed based on a standard PDA and wireless sensor nodes equipped with commercially available Bluetooth radio components, permitting real-time streaming of high-bandwidth data from various physiological and contextual sensors. We also present the results of abnormal gait diagnosis using the complete system from our evaluation, and illustrate how the wearable system and its operation can be remotely configured and managed by either enterprise systems or medical personnel at centralized locations. Conclusion: By using commercially available hardware components and software architecture presented in this paper, the MEDIC system can be rapidly configured, providing medical researchers with broadband sensor data from remote patients and platform access to best adapt operation for diagnostic operation objectives."

    :abstractText: Many sensing applications require monitoring phenomena with complex spatio-temporal dynamics spread over large spatial domains. Efficient monitoring of such phenomena would require an impractically large number of static sensors; therefore, actuated sensing - mobile robots carrying sensors - is required. Path planning for these robots, i.e., deciding on a subset of locations to observe, is critical for high fidelity monitoring of expansive areas with complex dynamics. We propose MUST - a MUltiscale approach with STochastic modeling. MUST is a hierarchical approach that models the phenomena as a stochastic Gaussian Process that is exploited to select a near-optimal subset of observation locations. We discuss in detail our proposed algorithm for the application of monitoring light intensity in a forest understory. We performed extensive empirical evaluations both in simulation using field data and on an actual cabled robotic system to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

    :abstractText: We present the Networked InfoMechanical System for Planar Translation, which is a novel two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) cable-driven robot with self-calibration and online drift-correction capabilities. This system is intended for actuated sensing applications in aquatic environments. The actuation redundancy resulting from in-plane translation driven by four cables results in an infinite set of tension distributions, thus requiring real-time computation of optimal tension distributions. To this end, we have implemented a highly efficient, iterative linear programming solver, which requires a very small number of iterations to converge to the optimal value. In addition, two novel self-calibration methods have been developed that leverage the robot's actuation redundancy. The first uses an incremental displacement, or jitter method, whereas the second uses variations in cable tensions to determine end-effector location. We also propose a novel least-squares drift-detection algorithm, which enables the robot to detect long-term drift. Combined with self-calibration capabilities, this drift-monitoring algorithm enables long-term autonomous operation. To verify the performance of our algorithms, we have performed extensive experiments in simulation and on a real system.

Next, we describe installation procedures, including novel calibration methods, that enable rapid in-field deployability for nonexpert end users, and provide simulations and experimental results to highlight their effectiveness. Kinematic and dynamic analysis of the system are provided, followed by a description of control methods.We provide experimental results that illustrate tracking of linear and nonlinear paths by NIMS3D. Thereafter, we briefly present an example of an actuated sensing task performed by the system. Finally, we describe methods of improving energy efficiency by leveraging nonlinear trajectories and energy-optimal tension distributions. Experimental and simulated results show that energy efficiency can be improved significantly by using optimized parabolic trajectories. Furthermore, we provide simulation results that demonstrate improved efficiency enabled by optimal, least norm tension distributions.

    :abstractText: The performance of a sensor network may be best judged by the quality of application specific information return. The actual sensing performance of a deployed sensor network depends on several factors which cannot be accounted at design time, such as environmental obstacles to sensing. We propose the use of mobility to overcome the effect of unpredictable environmental influence and to adapt to run time dynamics. Now, mobility with its dependencies such as precise localization and navigation is expensive in terms of hardware resources and energy constraints, and may not be feasible in compact, densely deployed and widespread sensor nodes. We present a method based on low complexity and low energy actuation primitives which are feasible for implementation in sensor networks. We prove how these primitives improve the detection capabilities with theoretical analysis, extensive simulations and real world experiments. The significant coverage advantage recurrent in our investigation justifies our own and other parallel ongoing work in the implementation and refinement of self-actuated systems.

    :abstractText: A broad range of embedded networked sensor (ENS) systems for critical environmental monitoring applications now require complex, high peak power dissipating sensor devices, as well as on-demand high performance computing and high bandwidth communication. Embedded computing demands for these new platforms include support for computationally intensive image and signal processing as well as optimization and statistical computing. To meet these new requirements while maintaining critical support for low energy operation, a new multiprocessor node hardware and software architecture, Low Power Energy Aware Processing (LEAP), has been developed. The LEAP architecture integrates fine-grained energy dissipation monitoring and sophisticated power control scheduling for all subsystems including sensor subsystems. This paper also describes a new distributed node testbed demonstrating that by exploiting high high energy efficiency components and enabling proper on-demand scheduling, the LEAP architecture may meet both sensing performance and energy dissipation objectives for a broad class of applications.

    :abstractText: This paper considers an estimation network of many distributed sensors with a certain correlation structure. Due to limited communication resources, the network selects only a subset of sensor measurements for estimation as long as the resulting fidelity is tolerable. We present a distributed sampling and estimation framework based on innovations diffusion, within which the sensor selection and estimation are accomplished through local computation and communications between sensor nodes. In order to achieve energy efficiency, the proposed algorithm uses a greedy heuristics to select a nearly minimum number of active sensors in order to ensure the desired fidelity for each estimation period. Extensive simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling scheme.

    :abstractText: This paper describes a new embedded networked sensor platform architecture that combines hardware and software tools providing detailed, fine-grained real-time energy usage information. We introduce the LEAP2 platform, a qualitative step forward over the previously developed LEAP and other similar platforms. LEAP2 is based on a new low power ASIC system and generally applicable supporting architecture that provides unprecedented capabilities for directly observing energy usage of multiple subsystems in real-time. Real-time observation with microsecond-scale time resolution enables direct accounting of energy dissipation for each computing task as well as for each hardware subsystem. The new hardware architecture is exploited with our new software tools, etop and endoscope. A series of experimental investigations provide high-resolution power information in networking, storage, memory and processing for primary embedded networked sensing applications. Using results obtained in real-time we show that for a large class of wireless sensor network nodes, there exist several interdependencies in energy consumptionbetween different subsystems. Through the use of our measurement tools we demonstrate that by carefully selecting the system operating points, energy savings of over 60% can be achieved while retaining system performance.

    :abstractText: New applications have recently appeared for a low power, low cost, &ldquo;embedded radio&rdquo;. These wireless interfaces for handheld mobile nodes and Wireless Integrated Network Sensors (WINS) must provide spread spectrum signaling for multi-user operation at 902-928 MHz. Cost considerations motivate the development of complete micropower CMOS RF systems operating at previously unexplored low power levels. Micropower CMOS VCO and mixer circuits, developed for these emerging narrow-band communication systems, are reported here. Design methods combining high-Q inductors and weak inversion MOSFET operation enable the lowest reported operating power for RF front end components including a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and mixer operating at frequencies of 400 MHz &mdash; 1 GHz. In addition, the VCO, by virtue of its high-Q inductive components, displays the lowest reported phase noise for 1 GHz CMOS VCO system for any power dissipation.

    :abstractText: The resolution at which a sensor network collects data is a crucial parameter of performance since it governs the range of applications that are feasible to be developed using that network. A higher resolution, in most situations, enables more applications and improves the reliability of existing ones. In this paper we discuss a system architecture that uses controlled motion to provide virtual high-resolution in a network of cameras. Several orders of magnitude advantage in resolution may be achieved, depending on tolerable tradeoffs. We discuss several system design choices in the context of our prototype camera network implementation that realizes the proposed architecture. We also mention how some of our techniques may apply to sensors other than cameras. Real world data is collected using our prototype system and used for the evaluation of our proposed methods.

    :abstractText: In distributed wireless sensing applications such as unattended ground sensor systems, remote planetary exploration, and condition-based maintenance, where the deployment site is remote and/or the scale of the network is large, individual emplacement and configuration of the sensor nodes is difficult. Hence, network self-assembly and continuous network self-organization during the lifetime of the network in a reliable, efficient, and scalable manner are crucial for successful deployment and operation of such networks. This paper provides an overview of the concept of network self-assembly for ad hoc wireless sensor networks at the link layer, with descriptions of results from implementation of a novel network formation mechanism for wireless unattended ground sensor applications using a multicluster hierarchical topology and a novel dual-radio architecture.

    :abstractText: Motion may be used in sensor networks to change the network configuration for improving the sensing performance. We consider the problem of controlling motion in a distributed manner for a mobile sensor network for a specific form of motion capability. Mobility itself may have a high resource overhead, hence we exploit motility, a constrained form of mobility, which has very low overheads but provides significant reconfiguration potential. We present an architecture that allows each node in the network to learn the medium and phenomenon characteristics. We describe a quantitative metric for sensing performance that is concretely tied to real sensor and medium characteristics, rather than assuming an abstract range based model. The problem of determining the desirable network configuration is expressed as an optimization of this metric. We present a distributed optimization algorithm which computes a desirable network configuration, and adapts it to environmental changes. The relationship of the proposed algorithm to simulated annealing and incremental subgradient descent based methods is discussed. A key property of our algorithm is that convergence to a desirable configuration can be proved even though no global coordination is involved. A network protocol to implement this algorithm is discussed, followed by simulations and experiments on a laboratory test bed.

    :abstractText: MIA (Mobile Inspection Assistance) is a wearable computer system that helps bridge inspectors collecting multimedia information in the field and producing the inspection report. MIA allows an inspector to fill out the inspection form, access previous inspection reports, make sketch(s) of the bridge element(s), take photograph(s), and produce the inspection report via a voice or pen interface. The first prototype of the system was developed by students in a Wearable Computer Project Design Course at Carnegie Mellon University during Spring 1998 semester. The hardware and software aspects of the system will be discussed, as well as the application of the system for inspection.

    :abstractText: Interoperability of software is a critical requirement in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, where a number of data exchange standards have been created to enable data exchange among different software packages. To be able to comply with existing data exchange standards, the software developers need to match their internal data schemas to the schema defined in a standard and vice versa. The process of matching two large scale data models is time consuming and cumbersome when performed manually, and becomes even more challenging when a source and/or a target model is being updated frequently to meet the ever expanding real world requirements. While several prior studies discussed the need for approaches toward automated or semi-automated schema matching, an approach that builds on existing matches between two models has rarely been studied. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach for model matching. This approach leverages a given set of existing matching between two models and upgrades those matching when a new version of a target model is released. The paper describes in detail a list of upgrade patterns generated and validated through a prototype by matching a domain-specific data model to several recent releases of the industry foundation classes.

    :abstractText: Within the last 20 years, much research and development has been conducted to deliver computer tools to assist engineers in performing their tasks. We are now experiencing the power of worldwide networked computing environments and the ability to easily share large quantities of information over geographically dispersed environments. However, are the computing environments available today supporting engineers in doing their job or defining how they must do their job? We need to develop systems that are more transparent and understandable to the users and that are more responsive to the individual needs and idiosyncrasies of the persons using these assistants.

    :abstractText: The research and development of a simulation-based decision support system (SB-DSS) capable of assisting early collaborative design processes is presented. The requirements for such a system are included. Existing collaborative DSSs are shown to lack the capability to manipulate complex simulation-based relationships. On the other hand, advances within the machine learning in design community are shown to have a potential for providing, but have not yet addressed, simulation-based support for collaborative design processes. The developed SB-DSS is described in terms of its four principal components. First, the behavior-evaluation (BE) model is used to both structure individual, domain-specific decision models and organize these models into a collaborative decision model. Second, a probabilistic framework for the BE model enables management of the uncertainty inherent in learning and using simulation-based knowledge. Significantly, this framework provides a constraint satisfaction environment in which simulation-based knowledge is used. Third, a statistical neural network approach is used to capture simulation-based knowledge and build the probabilistic behavior models based on this knowledge. Fourth, since a probability distribution theory does not exist for the nonlinear neural network approaches, Monte Carlo simulation is introduced as a method to sample the trained neural networks and approximate the likelihoods of design variable values. Consequently, constraint satisfaction problem-solving capability is obtained. In addition, a mapping of the SB-DSS architecture onto a collaborative design agent framework is provided. Experimental evaluation of a prototype SB-DSS system is summarized, and performance of the SB-DSS with respect to search and usability metrics is documented. Initial results in developing the simulation-based support for collaborative design are encouraging. Lastly, a categorization of the machine learning approach and a critique of the proposed categorization scheme is presented.

These are: scale, longevity, data of interest, and infrastructure integration. We present a tool, Que, which assists those sensor network deployments transitioning from prototypes to early production environments by addressing these issues. Que is able to simulate realistic deployments with faithful data, provide fast and iterative feedback on operations, and compose applications quickly in a platform-independent manner. We demonstrate Que's applicability via tests against our new data center environment-monitoring deployment, DataCenter.NET."

    :abstractText: Large-scale sensor network applications require in-network processing and data fusion to compute statistically relevant summaries of the sensed measurements. This paper studies distributed message-passing algorithms, in which neighboring nodes in the network pass local information relevant to a global computation, for performing statistical inference. We focus on the class of reweighted belief propagation (RBP) algorithms, which includes as special cases the standard sum-product and max-product algorithms for general networks with cycles, but in contrast to standard algorithms has attractive theoretical properties (uniqueness of fixed points, convergence, and robustness). Our main contribution is to design and implement a practical and modular architecture for implementing RBP algorithms in real networks. In addition, we show how intelligent scheduling of RBP messages can be used to minimize communication between motes and prolong the lifetime of the network. Our simulation and Mica2 mote deployment indicate that the proposed algorithms achieve accurate results despite real-world problems such as dying motes, dead and asymmetric links, and dropped messages. Overall, the class of RBP provides provides an ideal fit for sensor networks due to their distributed nature, requiring only local knowledge and coordination, and little requirements on other services such as reliable transmission.

    :abstractText: Clustering is an important mechanism in large multi-hop wireless sensor networks for obtaining scalability, reducing energy consumption and achieving better network performance. Most of the research in this area has focused on energy-efficient solutions, but has not thoroughly analyzed the network performance, e.g. in terms of data collection rate and time. The main objective of this paper is to provide a useful fully-distributed inference algorithm for clustering, based on belief propagation. The algorithm selects cluster heads, based on a unique set of global and local parameters, which finally achieves, under the energy constraints, improved network performance. Evaluation of the algorithm implementation shows an increase in throughput in more than 40% compared to HEED scheme. This advantage is expressed in terms of network reliability, data collection quality and transmission cost.

We evaluate the practicality of our approach using largescale simulations over a MSN Live Messenger subgraph consisting of about a million nodes. Our algorithms are general since they can be used for Peer-to-peer monitoring and for the efficient computation of other node ranking methods, such as PageRank and Information Centrality.

    :abstractText: Network coding is an emerging field of research with sound and mature theory supporting it. Recent works shows that it has many benefits like improved fault tolerance, higher flexibility in selection of file parts to transfer and resiliency to network partitions [4, 3]. Despite those appealing properties there is no wide usage of network coding in real file sharing applications. In this work, we try to bridge the gap between theory of network coding and practice. From the one hand, we deploy one the most successful file sharing client, the BitTorrent client. We use the BitTorrent algorithm for optimizing the neighbor selections for maximizing the upload bandwidth. From the other hand, we propose several simple heuristics that improve significantly the efficiency of the network coding deployed. In a nutshell, we propose computation intensive variant of network coding that can be applied to most of the existing network coding protocols. By changing the random selection of coded parts to a selection based on feedback from the network, we significantly improve the network utilization and the efficiency of the protocol. In this paper we report our work in progress building the BitCod client. Using extensive simulations we demonstrate that our technique can compete with the performance of the state-of-the-art BitTorrent [2] file sharing client. Next, we plan to implement and test a prototype of the BitCod client over the WAN.

    :abstractText: We propose an efficient framework for enabling secure multi-party numerical computations in a Peer-to-Peer network. This problem arises in a range of applications such as collaborative filtering, distributed computation of trust and reputation, monitoring and numerous other tasks, where the computing nodes would like to preserve the privacy of their inputs while performing a joint computation of a certain function. Although there is a rich literature in the field of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party computation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scalePeer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we examine several possible approaches and discuss their feasibility. Among the possible approaches, we identify a single approach which is both scalable and theoretically secure. An additional novel contribution is that we show how to compute the neighborhood based collaborative filtering, a state-of-the-art collaborative filtering algorithm, winner of the Netflix progress prize of the year 2007. Our solution computes this algorithm in a Peer-to-Peer network, using a privacy preserving computation, without loss of accuracy. Using extensive large scale simulations on top of real Internet topologies, we demonstrate the applicability of our approach. Asfar as we know, we are the first to implement such a large scale secure multi-party simulation of networks of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges.

    :abstractText: Many challenging tasks in sensor networks, including sensor calibration, ranking of nodes, monitoring, event region detection, collaborative filtering, collaborative signal processing, etc., can be formulated as a problem of solving a linear system of equations. Several recent works propose different distributed algorithms for solving these problems, usually by using linear iterative numerical methods.In this work, we extend the settings of the above approaches, by adding another dimension to the problem. Specifically, we are interested in self-stabilizing algorithms, that continuously run and converge to a solution from any initial state. This aspect of the problem is highly important due to the dynamic nature of the network and the frequent changes in the measured environment.In this paper, we link together algorithms from two different domains. On the one hand, we use the rich linear algebra literature of linear iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations, which are naturally distributed with rapid convergence properties. On the other hand, we are interested in self-stabilizing algorithms, where the input to the computation is constantly changing, and we would like the algorithms to converge from any initial state. We propose a simple novel method called SS-Iterative as a self-stabilizing variant of the linear iterative methods. We prove that under mild conditions the self-stabilizing algorithm converges to a desired result. We further extend these results to handle the asynchronous case.As a case study, we discuss the sensor calibration problem and provide simulation results to support the applicability of our approach.

    :abstractText: Recent work by Zymnis et al. proposes an efficient primal-dual interior-point method, using a truncated Newton method, for solving the network utility maximization (NUM) problem. This method has shown superior performance relative to the traditional dual-decomposition approach. Other recent work by Bickson et ale shows how to compute efficiently and distributively the Newton step, which is the main computational bottleneck of the Newton method, utilizing the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm. In the current work, we combine both approaches to create an efficient distributed algorithm for solving the NUM problem. Unlike the work of Zymnis, which uses a centralized approach, our new algorithm is easily distributed. Using an empirical evaluation we show that our new method outperforms previous approaches, including the truncated Newton method and dual-decomposition methods. As an additional contribution, this is the first work that evaluates the performance of the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm vs. the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, for a large scale problem.

    :abstractText: One of the main challenges in building a large scale publish subcribe infrastructure in an enterprise network, is to provide the subscribers with the required information, while minimizing the consumed host and network resources. Typically, previous approaches utilize either IP multicast or point-to-point unicast for efficient dissemination of the information. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid framework, which is a combination of both multicast and unicast data dissemination. Our hybrid framework allows us to take the advantages of both multicast and unicast, while avoiding their drawbacks. We investigate several algorithms for computing the best mapping of publishers' transmissions into multicast and unicast transport. Using extensive simulations, we show that our hybrid framework reduces consumed host and network resources, outperforming traditional solutions. To insure the subscribers interests closely resemble those of real-world settings, our simulations are based on stock market data and on recorded IBM WebShpere subscriptions.

    :abstractText: Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) is an iterative message-passing algorithm for inference in Gaussian graphical models. It is known that when GaBP converges it converges to the correct MAP estimate of the Gaussian random vector and simple sufficient conditions for its convergence have been established. In this paper we develop a double-loop algorithm for forcing convergence of GaBP. Our method computes the correct MAP estimate even in cases where standard GaBP would not have converged. We further extend this construction to compute least-squares solutions of over-constrained linear systems. We believe that our construction has numerous applications, since the GaBP algorithm is linked to solution of linear systems of equations, which is a fundamental problem in computer science and engineering. As a case study, we discuss the linear detection problem. We show that using our new construction, we are able to force convergence of Montanari's linear detection algorithm, in cases where it would originally fail. As a consequence, we are able to increase significantly the number of users that can transmit concurrently.

    :abstractText: "Web applications suffer from software and configuration faults that lower their availability. Recovering from failure is dominated by the time interval between when these faults appear and when they are detected by site operators. We introduce a set of tools that augment the ability of operators to perceive the presence of failure: an automatic anomaly detector scours HTTP access logs to find changes in user behavior that are indicative of site failures, and a visualizer helps operators rapidly detect and diagnose problems. Visualization addresses a key question of autonomic computing of how to win operators\xC3\xBD confidence so that new tools will be embraced. Evaluation performed using HTTP logs from Ebates.com demonstrates that these tools can enhance the detection of failure as well as shorten detection time. Our approach is application-generic and can be applied to any Web application without the need for instrumentation."

    :abstractText: Previous work showed that statistical analysis techniques could successfully be used to construct compact signatures of distinct operational problems in Internet server systems. Because signatures are amenable to well-known similarity search techniques, they can be used as a way to index past problems and identify particular operational problems as new or recurrent. In this paper we use a different statistical technique for constructing signatures (logistic regression with L1 regularization) that improves on previous work in two ways. First, our new approach works for cases where the number of features is an order of magnitude larger than the number of samples and also scales to problems with over 50,000 samples. Second, we get encouraging results regarding the stability of the models and the signatures by cross-validating the accuracy of the models from one section of the data center on another section. We validate our approach on data from an Internet service testbed and also from a production enterprise system comprising hundreds of servers in several data centers.

    :abstractText: Contemporary datacenters comprise hundreds or thousands of machines running applications requiring high availability and responsiveness. Although a performance crisis is easily detected by monitoring key end-to-end performance indicators (KPIs) such as response latency or request throughput, the variety of conditions that can lead to KPI degradation makes it difficult to select appropriate recovery actions. We propose and evaluate a methodology for automatic classification and identification of crises, and in particular for detecting whether a given crisis has been seen before, so that a known solution may be immediately applied. Our approach is based on a new and efficient representation of the datacenter's state called a fingerprint, constructed by statistical selection and summarization of the hundreds of performance metrics typically collected on such systems. Our evaluation uses 4 months of trouble-ticket data from a production datacenter with hundreds of machines running a 24x7 enterprise-class user-facing application. In experiments in a realistic and rigorous operational setting, our approach provides operators the information necessary to initiate recovery actions with 80% correctness in an average of 10 minutes, which is 50 minutes earlier than the deadline provided to us by the operators. To the best of our knowledge this is the first rigorous evaluation of any such approach on a large-scale production installation.

    :abstractText: Evaluating the resiliency of stateful Internet services to significant workload spikes and data hotspots requires realistic workload traces that are usually very difficult to obtain. A popular approach is to create a workload model and generate synthetic workload, however, there exists no characterization and model of stateful spikes. In this paper we analyze five workload and data spikes and find that they vary significantly in many important aspects such as steepness, magnitude, duration, and spatial locality. We propose and validate a model of stateful spikes that allows us to synthesize volume and data spikes and could thus be used by both cloud computing users and providers to stress-test their infrastructure.

    :abstractText: Reducing management costs and improving the availability of large-scale distributed systems require automatic replica regeneration, that is, creating new replicas in response to replica failures. A major challenge to regeneration is maintaining consistency when the replica group changes. Doing so is particularly difficult across the wide area where failure detection is complicated by network congestion and node overload.In this context, this article presents Om, the first read/write peer-to-peer, wide-area storage system that achieves high availability and manageability through online automatic regeneration while still preserving consistency guarantees. We achieve these properties through the following techniques. First, by utilizing the limited view divergence property in today's Internet and by adopting the witness model, Om is able to regenerate from any single replica, rather than requiring a majority quorum, at the cost of a small (10&minus;6 in our experiments) probability of violating consistency during each regeneration. As a result, Om can deliver high availability with a small number of replicas, while traditional designs would significantly increase the number of replicas. Next, we distinguish failure-free reconfigurations from failure-induced ones, enabling common reconfigurations to proceed with a single round of communication. Finally, we use a lease graph among the replicas and a two-phase write protocol to optimize for reads, so that reads in Om can be processed by any single replica. Experiments on PlanetLab show that consistent regeneration in Om completes in approximately 20 seconds.

    :abstractText: "The explosive growth in unwanted email has prompted the development of techniques for the rejection of email, intended to shield recipients from the onerous task of identifying the legitimate email in their inboxes amid a sea of spam. Unfortunately, widely used content-based filtering systems have converted the spam problem into a false positive one: email has become unreliable. Email acceptance techniques complement rejection ones; they can help prevent false positives by filing email into a user's inbox before it is considered for rejection. Whitelisting, whereby recipients accept email from some set of authorized senders, is one such acceptance technique. We present Reliable Email (RE:), a new whitelisting system that incurs zero false positives among socially connected users. Unlike previous whitelisting systems, which require that whitelists be populated manually, RE: exploits friend-of-friend relationships among email correspondents to populate whitelists automatically. To do so, RE: permits an email's recipient to discover whether other email users have whitelisted the email's sender, while preserving the privacy of users' email contacts with cryptographic private matching techniques. Using real email traces from two sites, we demonstrate that RE: renders a significant fraction of received email reliable. Our evaluation also shows that RE: can prevent up to 88% of the false positives incurred by a widely deployed email rejection system, at modest computational cost."

    :abstractText: The tradeoffs between consistency, performance, and availability are well understood. Traditionally, however, designers of replicated systems have been forced to choose from either strong consistency guarantees or none at all. This paper explores the semantic space between traditional strong and optimistic consistency models for replicated services. We argue that an important class of applications can tolerate relaxed consistency, but benefit from bounding the maximum rate of inconsistent access in an application-specific manner. Thus, we develop a set of metrics, Numerical Error, Order Error, and Staleness, to capture the consistency spectrum. We then present the design and implementation of TACT, a middleware layer that enforces arbitrary consistency bounds among replicas using these metrics. Finally, we show that three replicated applications demonstrate significant semantic and performance benefits from using our framework.

    :abstractText: With n servers that independently fail with probability of p < 0.5, it is well known that the majority quorum system achieves the best availability among all quorum systems. However, even this optimal construction requires (n+1)/2 functioning servers out of n. Furthermore, the number of probes needed to acquire a quorum is also lower bounded by (n+1)/2.Motivated by the need for a highly available and low probe complexity quorum system in the Internet, this paper proposes signed quorum systems (SQS) that can be available as long as any O(1) servers are available, and simultaneously have O(1) probe complexity. SQS provides probabilistic intersection guarantees and exploits the property of independent mismatches in today's Internet. Such key property has been validated previously under multiple Internet measurement traces. This paper then extensively studies the availability, probe complexity, and load of SQS, derives lower bounds for all three metrics, and constructs matching upper bounds. We show that in addition to the qualitatively superior availability and probe complexity, SQS also decouples availability from load and probe complexity, so that optimal availability can be achieved under most probe complexity and load values.

    :abstractText: Today, the utility of many replicated Internet services is limited by availability rather than raw performance. To better understand the effects of replica placement on availability, we propose the problem of minimal replication cost for availability. Let replication cost be the cost associated with replica deployment, dynamic replica creation and teardown at n candidate locations. Given client access patterns, replica failure patterns, network partition patterns, a required consistency level and a target level of availability, the minimal replication cost is the lower bound on a system's replication cost. Solving this problem also answers the dual question of optimal availability given a constraint on replication cost.We design the first algorithm we are aware of to solve the problem, through reduction to integer linear programming and enumeration of pruned serialization orders. Using practical faultloads and workloads, we demonstrate that the exponential complexity of our algorithm is tractable for practical problems with hundreds of candidate locations. The lower bound computed by our algorithm is tight, but the tightness can be sacrificed by a proposed optimization for large problems. We also show that with low replica creation and teardown costs, the bound is close to tight in practical problems even with the optimization.

    :abstractText: An ultimate goal for modern Internet services is the development of scalable, high-performance, highly available and fault-tolerant systems. Replication is an important approach to achieve this goal. However, replication introduces the issue of consistency among replicas, which is further complicated by network partitions. Generally, higher consistency levels result in lower system availability in the presence of network partitions. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between consistency and availability in building replicated Internet services.In this paper, we argue that Internet services can benefit from dynamically choosing availability/consistency tradeoffs. With three consistency metrics, Unseen Writes, Uncommitted Writes and Staleness, we show how consistency can be meaningfully quantified for many Internet services. We present the design of the TACT (Tunable Availability and Consistency Tradeoffs) toolkit that allows Internet services to flexibly and dynamically choose their own availability/consistency tradeoffs, enabling differentiated availability/consistency quality of service. Further, TACT makes it possible for Internet services to dynamically trade consistency for performance.

    :abstractText: Reducing management costs and improving the availability of large-scale distributed systems require automatic replica regeneration, that is, creating new replicas in response to replica failures. A major challenge to regeneration is maintaining consistency when the replica group changes. Doing so is particularly difficult across the wide area where failure detection is complicated by network congestion and node overload.In this context, this article presents Om, the first read/write peer-to-peer, wide-area storage system that achieves high availability and manageability through online automatic regeneration while still preserving consistency guarantees. We achieve these properties through the following techniques. First, by utilizing the limited view divergence property in today's Internet and by adopting the witness model, Om is able to regenerate from any single replica, rather than requiring a majority quorum, at the cost of a small (10&minus;6 in our experiments) probability of violating consistency during each regeneration. As a result, Om can deliver high availability with a small number of replicas, while traditional designs would significantly increase the number of replicas. Next, we distinguish failure-free reconfigurations from failure-induced ones, enabling common reconfigurations to proceed with a single round of communication. Finally, we use a lease graph among the replicas and a two-phase write protocol to optimize for reads, so that reads in Om can be processed by any single replica. Experiments on PlanetLab show that consistent regeneration in Om completes in approximately 20 seconds.

    :abstractText: We consider the Outsourced Aggregation model, where sensing services outsource their sensor data collection and aggregation tasks to third-party service providers called aggregators. As aggregators can be untrusted or compromised, it is essential for a sensing service to be able to verify the correctness of aggregation results. This work presents SECOA, a framework with a family of novel and optimally-secure protocols for secure outsourced aggregation. Our framework is based on a unified use of one-way chains. It supports a large and diverse set of aggregate functions, can have multiple hierarchically organized aggregators, can deterministically detect any malicious aggregation behavior without communication with sensors, and incurs a small and workload-independent communication load on sensors. We also present extensive evaluation results to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework.

    :abstractText: Building highly available enterprise applications using Web-oriented middleware is hard. Runtime implementations frequently do not address the problems of application state persistence and fault-tolerance, placing the burden of managing session state and, in particular, handling system failures on application programmers. This paper describes Phoenix/APP, a runtime service based on the notion of recovery guarantees. Phoenix/APP transparently masks failures and automatically recovers component-based applications. This both increases application availability and simplifies application development. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by describing the design and implementation of Phoenix/APP in Microsoft's .NET runtime and present results on the cost of persisting and recovering component-based applications.

    :abstractText: "Wireless sensor networks are often queried for aggregates such as predicate count, sum, and average. In untrusted environments, sensors may potentially be compromised. Existing approaches for securely answering aggregation queries in untrusted sensor networks can detect whether the aggregation result is corrupted by an attacker. However, the attacker (controlling the compromised sensors) can keep corrupting the result, rendering the system unavailable. This paper aims to enable aggregation queries to tolerate instead of just detecting the adversary. To this end, we propose a novel tree sampling algorithm that directly uses sampling to answer aggregation queries. It leverages a novel set sampling technique to overcome a key and well-known obstacle in sampling \xE2\x80\x94 traditional sampling technique is only effective when the predicate count or sum is large. Set sampling can efficiently sample a set of sensors together, and determine whether any sensor in the set satisfies the predicate (but not how many). With set sampling as a building block, tree sampling can provably generate a correct answer despite adversarial interference, while without the drawbacks of traditional sampling techniques."

    :abstractText: Motivated by recent emerging systems that can leverage partially correct packets in wireless networks, this paper investigates the novel concept of error estimating codes (EEC). Without correcting the errors in the packet, EEC enables the receiver of the packet to estimate the packet's bit error rate, which is perhaps the most important meta-information of a partially correct packet. Our EEC algorithm provides provable estimation quality, with rather low redundancy and computational overhead. To demonstrate the utility of EEC, we exploit and implement EEC in two wireless network applications, Wi-Fi rate adaptation and real-time video streaming. Our real-world experiments show that these applications can significantly benefit from EEC.

    :abstractText: We present a robust automatic method for modeling cyclic 3D human motion such as walking using motion-capture data. The pose of the body is represented by a time-series of joint angles which are automatically segmented into a sequence of motion cycles. The mean and the principal components of these cycles are computed using a new algorithm that enforces smooth transitions between the cycles by operating in the Fourier domain. Key to this method is its ability to automatically deal with noise and missing data. A learned walking model is then exploited for Bayesian tracking of 3D human motion.

    :abstractText: In this paper we investigate two aspects of ranking problems on large graphs. First, we augment the deterministic pruning algorithm in Sarkar and Moore (2007) with sampling techniques to compute approximately correct rankings with high probability under random walk based proximity measures at query time. Second, we prove some surprising locality properties of these proximity measures by examining the short term behavior of random walks. The proposed algorithm can answer queries on the fly without caching any information about the entire graph. We present empirical results on a 600, 000 node author-word-citation graph from the Citeseer domain on a single CPU machine where the average query processing time is around 4 seconds. We present quantifiable link prediction tasks. On most of them our techniques outperform Personalized Pagerank, a well-known diffusion based proximity measure.

    :abstractText: This paper explores two aspects of social network modeling. First, we generalize a successful static model of relationships into a dynamic model that accounts for friendships drifting over time. Second, we show how to make it tractable to learn such models from data, even as the number of entities n gets large. The generalized model associates each entity with a point in p-dimensional Euclidean latent space. The points can move as time progresses but large moves in latent space are improbable. Observed links between entities are more likely if the entities are close in latent space. We show how to make such a model tractable (sub-quadratic in the number of entities) by the use of appropriate kernel functions for similarity in latent space; the use of low dimensional KD-trees; a new efficient dynamic adaptation of multidimensional scaling for a first pass of approximate projection of entities into latent space; and an efficient conjugate gradient update rule for non-linear local optimization in which amortized time per entity during an update is O(log n). We use both synthetic and real-world data on up to 11,000 entities which indicate near-linear scaling in computation time and improved performance over four alternative approaches. We also illustrate the system operating on twelve years of NIPS co-authorship data.

    :abstractText: In this paper we consider the problem of re-ranking search results by incorporating user feedback. We present a graph theoretic measure for discriminating irrelevant results from relevant results using a few labeled examples provided by the user. The key intuition is that nodes relatively closer (in graph topology) to the relevant nodes than the irrelevant nodes are more likely to be relevant. We present a simple sampling algorithm to evaluate this measure at specific nodes of interest, and an efficient branch and bound algorithm to compute the top k nodes from the entire graph under this measure. On quantifiable prediction tasks the introduced measure outperforms other diffusion-based proximity measures which take only the positive relevance feedback into account. On the Entity-Relation graph built from the authors and papers of the entire DBLP citation corpus (1.4 million nodes and 2.2 million edges) our branch and bound algorithm takes about 1.5 seconds to retrieve the top 10 nodes w.r.t. this measure with 10 labeled nodes.

    :abstractText: Salmonella is among the most common food borne illnesses which may result from consumption of contaminated products. In this paper we model the co-occurrence data between USDA-controlled food processing establishments and various strains of Salmonella (serotypes) as a network which evolves over time. We apply a latent space model originally developed for dynamic analysis of social networks to predict the future link structure of the graph. Experimental results indicate predictive utility of analyzing establishments as a network of interconnected entities as opposed to modeling their risk independently of each other. The model can be used to predict occurrences of a particular strain of Salmonella in the future. That could potentially aid in proactive monitoring of establishments at risk, allowing for early intervention and mitigation of adverse consequences to public health.

    :abstractText: This paper evaluates trade-offs between agility and reliability of predictions arising due to sparseness of data modeled with dynamic social networks. We use real field data from food safety domain to illustrate the discussion. We model food production facilities as one type of entities in a social network evolving in time. Another type of entities denotes various specific strains of Salmonella. Two entities are linked in the graph if a microbial test of food sample conducted at the specific food facility over specific period of time turns out positive for the particular pathogen. We use a computationally efficient latent space model to predict future occurrences of pathogens in individual facilities. Empirical results indicate predictive utility of the proposed representation. However, sparseness of data limits the attainable agility of predictions. We identify exploiting recency of data and using the known patterns in it, such as seasonality, as plausible means of battling the challenge of sparseness.

    :abstractText: "Link prediction, personalized graph search, fraud detection, and many such graph mining problems revolve around the computation of the most \"similar\" k nodes to a given query node. One widely used class of similarity measures is based on random walks on graphs, e.g., personalized pagerank, hitting and commute times, and simrank. There are two fundamental problems associated with these measures. First, existing online algorithms typically examine the local neighborhood of the query node which can become significantly slower whenever high-degree nodes are encountered (a common phenomenon in real-world graphs). We prove that turning high degree nodes into sinks results in only a small approximation error, while greatly improving running times. The second problem is that of computing similarities at query time when the graph is too large to be memory-resident. The obvious solution is to split the graph into clusters of nodes and store each cluster on a disk page; ideally random walks will rarely cross cluster boundaries and cause page-faults. Our contributions here are twofold: (a) we present an efficient deterministic algorithm to find the k closest neighbors (in terms of personalized pagerank) of any query node in such a clustered graph, and (b) we develop a clustering algorithm (RWDISK) that uses only sequential sweeps over data files. Empirical results on several large publicly available graphs like DBLP, Citeseer and Live-Journal (~ 90 M edges) demonstrate that turning high degree nodes into sinks not only improves running time of RWDISK by a factor of 3 but also boosts link prediction accuracy by a factor of 4 on average. We also show that RWDISK returns more desirable (high conductance and small size) clusters than the popular clustering algorithm METIS, while requiring much less memory. Finally our deterministic algorithm for computing nearest neighbors incurs far fewer page-faults (factor of 5) than actually simulating random walks."

The last couple of years, however, have seen the emergence of new academic programs, conferences, and journals dedicated to games studies. This panel discusses a variety of ways, and whys, for introducing games into computer science curricula. Panelists discuss their experiences in designing a broad range of courses including a games course for women, a software development course that uses games as projects, an introductory games programming course in Java, and an advanced graphics course that focuses on games.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose a new method for simulating reactive motions for running or walking human figures. The goal is to generate realistic animations of how humans compensate for large external forces and maintain balance while running or walking. We simulate the reactive motions of adjusting the body configuration and altering footfall locations in response to sudden external disturbance forces on the body. With our proposed method, the user first imports captured motion data of a run or walk cycle to use as the primary motion. While executing the primary motion, an external force is applied to the body. The system automatically calculates a reactive motion for the center of mass and angular momentum around the center of mass using an enhanced version of the linear inverted pendulum model. Finally, the trajectories of the generalized coordinates that realize the precalculated trajectories of the center of mass, zero moment point, and angular momentum are obtained using constrained inverse kinematics. The advantage of our method is that it is possible to calculate reactive motions for bipeds that preserve dynamic balance during locomotion, which was difficult using previous techniques. We demonstrate our results on an application that allows a user to interactively apply external perturbations to a running or walking virtual human model. We expect this technique to be useful for human animations in interactive 3D systems such as games, virtual reality, and potentially even the control of actual biped robots.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present efficient solutions for planning motions of dual-arm manipulation and regrasping tasks. Motion planning for such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom (DoF) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position, i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for one or both hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible IK solutions at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we present two probabilistically complete RRT-based motion planning algorithms (J+-RRT and IK-RRT) that interleave the search for an IK solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The capabilities of combining IK methods and planners are shown both in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III performing dual-arm tasks in a kitchen environment.

    :abstractText: We present a method for interactively guiding the navigation of a humanoid robot through complex terrain via an intuitive path-drawing interface. In contrast to full autonomy or direct teleoperation of the robot, the user suggests an overall global navigation route by "drawing" a path onto the environment while the robot is walking. The path is used by a footstep planner that searches online for a sequence of suitable footstep locations that follow the indicated path as closely as possible while respecting the robot dynamics and overall navigation safety. In this way, the planner provides the robot partial autonomy in selecting precise footstep sequences while the human operator retains high-level control of the global navigation route. We present experimental results of the complete system on the biped humanoid HRP-2 navigating on and around various platforms, chairs, and stairs. We use an augmented reality system so that interactively drawing paths on the world is intuitive and natural.

Sensing of the environment is performed by a pivoting laser scanner, which continues to update the terrain representation as the robot walks. Safe stepping motions are planned from this data to follow the user's command, given in the form of an end goal, a rough path, or a joystick input. Results are demonstrated on a prototype robot in several environments.

    :abstractText: We present a novel method to model and synthesize variation in motion data. Given a few examples of a particular type of motion as input, we learn a generative model that is able to synthesize a family of spatial and temporal variants that are statistically similar to the input examples. The new variants retain the features of the original examples, but are not exact copies of them. We learn a Dynamic Bayesian Network model from the input examples that enables us to capture properties of conditional independence in the data, and model it using a multivariate probability distribution. We present results for a variety of human motion, and 2D handwritten characters. We perform a user study to show that our new variants are less repetitive than typical game and crowd simulation approaches of re-playing a small number of existing motion clips. Our technique can synthesize new variants efficiently and has a small memory requirement.

The sensor network models the danger levels sensed across its area and has the ability to adapt to changes. It represents the dangerous areas as obstacles. A protocol that combines the artificial potential field of the sensors with the goal location for the moving object guides the object incrementally across the network to the goal, while maintaining the safest distance to the danger areas. We give the analysis to the protocol and report on hardware experiments using a physical sensor network consisting of Mote sensors.

    :abstractText: "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics: while a robot navigates in an unknown environment, it must incrementally build a map of its surroundings and, at the same time, localize itself within that map. One popular solution is to treat SLAM as an estimation problem and apply the Kalman filter; this approach is elegant, but it does not scale well: the size of the belief state and the time complexity of the filter update both grow quadratically in the number of landmarks in the map. This paper presents a filtering technique that maintains a tractable approximation of the belief state as a thin junction tree. The junction tree grows under filter updates and is periodically \"thinned\" via efficient maximum likelihood projections so inference remains tractable. When applied to the SLAM problem, these thin junction tree filters have a linear-space belief state and a linear-time filtering operation. Further approximation yields a filtering operation that is often constant-time. Experiments on a suite of SLAM problems validate the approach."

    :abstractText: Probabilistic inference problems arise naturally in distributed systems such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Inference algorithms that use message passing are a natural fit for distributed systems, but they must be robust to the failure situations that arise in real-world settings, such as unreliable communication and node failures. Unfortunately, the popular sum--product algorithm can yield very poor estimates in these settings because the nodes' beliefs before convergence can be arbitrarily different from the correct posteriors. In this paper, we present a new message passing algorithm for probabilistic inference which provides several crucial guarantees that the standard sum--product algorithm does not. Not only does it converge to the correct posteriors, but it is also guaranteed to yield a principled approximation at any point before convergence. In addition, the computational complexity of the message passing updates depends only upon the model, and is independent of the network topology of the distributed system. We demonstrate the approach with detailed experimental results on a distributed sensor calibration task using data from an actual sensor network deployment.

    :abstractText: Monitoring its health by detecting its failed sensors is essential to the reliable functioning of any sensor network. This paper presents a distributed, online, sequential algorithm for detecting multiple faults in a sensor network. The algorithm works by detecting change points in the correlation statistics of neighboring sensors, requiring only neighbors to exchange information. The algorithm provides guarantees on detection delay and false alarm probability. This appears to be the first work to offer such guarantees for a multiple sensor network. Based on the performance guarantees, we compute a tradeoff between sensor node density, detection delay and energy consumption. We also address synchronization, finite storage and data quantization. We validate our approach with some example applications.

    :abstractText: The concept of Riemannian geometries is used to construct induced homogeneous point sets on manifolds that are based on well-distributed point sets in unit cubes of an appropriately chosen Euclidean space. These well-distributed point sets in unit cubes are based on standard low-discrepancy sequences. The approach is algorithmic, that is, the methods developed in this article have been implemented and tested. Applications in image processing, graph theory and measurement-based exploration are presented.

    :abstractText: "This paper is concerned with algorithmic techniques for the incremental generation of continuous curves that can efficiently cover an abstract surface. We introduce the notion of low-discrepancy curves as an extension of the notion of low-discrepancy sequences\xE2\x80\x94such that sufficiently smooth curves with low-discrepancy properties can be defined and generated. We then devise a procedure for lifting these curves, that efficiently cover the unit cube, to abstract surfaces, such as nonlinear manifolds. We present algorithms that yield suitable fair mappings between the unit cube and the abstract surface. We demonstrate the application of these ideas using some concrete examples of interest in robotics."

    :abstractText: Problems arising from router misconfigurations cost time and money. The first step in fixing such misconfigurations is finding them. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting misconfigurations that does not depend on an a priori model of what constitutes a correct configuration. Our hypothesis is that uncommon or unexpected misconfigurations in router data can be identified as statistical anomalies within a Bayesian framework. We present a detection algorithm based on this framework, and show that it is able to detect errors in the router configuration files of a university network.

    :abstractText: "Future very high end systems, petaflops computers, will be megaprocessors or megacores with a million or more active processors. This can be derived both by extrapolation of the processor number of the leading systems in the TOP500 and by the consideration of multi- and many-core microprocessors for energy efficiency reasons. Part of processors could also be application specific accelerators as latest microprocessor architectures support interfaces to such devices. The large number of processors will also impose fault tolerance strategies making the system architectures highly heterogeneous and dynamic. To sum up: petaflops systems will be massively parallel and use heterogeneous and dynamic processor arrangements. Such architectures pose the question of scalability and programmability in general. The talk describes the challanges of such systems for existing application programs, programming languages and models as well as programming tools.

    :abstractText: The use of supercomputing technology, parallel and distributed processing, and sophisticated algorithms is of major importance for computational scientists. Yet, the scientists' goals are to solve their challenging scientific problems, not the software engineering tasks associated with it. For this reason, computational science and engineering must be able to rely on dedicated support from program development and analysis tools.

    :abstractText: Multi-core technologies, application specific accelerators and fault tolerance requirements are defining a new hardware basis for high performance computing systems. Multi-core will make evolve parallelism from a niche product in HPC to the standard programming model and, therefore, trigger new developments in languages, environments and tools. Accelerators and dynamic system behaviour from fault tolerance will make virtualization techniques necessary to support programmability. Energy efficiency as a new optimization target for HPCN systems will force future systems to bring all of these techniques together.

    :abstractText: Today, computers and computational methods are increasingly important and powerful tools for science and engineering. Yet, using them effectively and efficiently requires both, expert knowledge of the respective application domain as well as solid experience applying the technologies. Only the combination allows new and faster advancement in the area of application. The same is true for establishing new computational concepts as regular methods in the field of application. This applies to either quantitative improvement (e.g. by parallel scalability) or by qualitative progress (e.g. by better algorithms).

    :abstractText: Adaboost algorithm is difficult to implement on embedded platform for real-time face detection by software due to its high computation load and data throughput. This article presents a cell array architecture using parallel technology. Detection procedure can be greatly speeded up with its multipipeline. Besides it makes use of the continuity of image data to decrease the accesses to RAM. This article uses Electronic System Level (ESL) tools to develop and simulate a cycle-accurate model of the cell array architecture. The result shows that cell array architecture with 200MHz clock can process 12 million HAAR features per second and detect faces on a 176*144 image at the frame rate of 103 frames per second, which is 14 times speedup compared with software implementation.

    :abstractText: Among the many directions of IT, the most pervasive is the fusion of information processing with physical processes - called embedded computing. It is the basic engine of innovation and source of competitiveness for broad range of industrial sectors from automotive to telecommunications and from aerospace to manufacturing. Embedded computing transforms products, creates new markets and disrupts the status quo. Embedded computing is rapidly taking over the role of being the universal system integrator for physical systems.Prominent leaders of industrial and academic R&D organizations will discuss the consistency between present and future application challenges as seen by industry and dominating research challenges as conceived by academia.

    :abstractText: This talk describes a state-centric abstraction for application users to interact with sensor networks. Just as in data-centric routing and storage where physical nodes are less important than the data itself, state-centric abstraction introduces "states" as a natural vocabulary to describe spatio-temporal physical phenomena that the sensor networks are typically designed for. Application programmers specify the computation as creation, sharing, and transformation of states, which naturally map to descriptions in signal processing and control applications. We argue that due to the dynamic nature of sensor networks, programs written in state-centric abstractions are more invariant to constant changes in data stream configurations and make the resulting software more portable across multiple sensor network platforms. With help of models of sensor collaboration, sensing, and estimation, the state-centric specifications are mapped into collaborative processing tasks at compile time, and further maintained at run time, leveraging the data-centric caching and routing services. We use a multi-target tracking system as an example to show how state-centric programming models can raise the abstraction level for users to interact with sensor networks and help modularize the design.

    :abstractText: Embedded systems with heterogeneous processors extend the energy/timing trade-off flexibility and provide the opportunity to fine tune resource utilization for particular applications. In this paper, we present a resource model that considers the time and energy costs of run-time mode switching, which considerably improves the accuracy of existing models. Given an application, the software partitioning problem then becomes an optimization over energy cost given deadline constraints, which can be formulate as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. We apply the resource modeling and software partitioning techniques to a multimodule embedded sensing device, the mPlatform, and present a case study of configuring the platform for a real-time sound source localization application on a stack of MSP430 and ARM7 processor based sensing and processing boards.

    :abstractText: Envision the situation that high quality information and entertainment is easily accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time, and on any device. How realistic is this vision? And what does it require from the underlying technology? Ambient Intelligence (AmI) integrates concepts ranging from ubiquitous computing to autonomous and intelligent systems. An AmI environment will be highly dynamic in many aspects. Underlying technology must be very flexible to cope with this dynamism. Scalability of technology is only one crucial aspect. This paper explores scalability from the processing, the communication, and the software perspectives.

    :abstractText: Extracting structures as communicable knowledge is a central problem in spatio-temporal data analysis. Spatial Aggregation is an effective way for discovering structures. To address the computational challenges posed by applications such as weather data analysis or engineering optimization, Spatial Aggregation recursively aggregates local data into higher-level descriptions, exploiting the fact that these physical phenomena can be described as spatio-temporally coherent "objects" due to continuity and locality in the underlying physics. This paper uses several problem domains -- weather data interpretation, distributed control optimization, and spatio-temporal diffusion-reaction pattern analysis -- to demonstrate that intelligent simulation tools built upon the principles of Spatial Aggregation are indispensable for scientific discovery and engineering analysis.

    :abstractText: Microservers are networked embedded devices that accept user tasks on demand and execute them on real world information collected by sensors. Sharing intermediate sensing and computing results among these tasks is critical for optimal resource utilization. This paper presents a service-oriented microserver runtime --- Share and its semantics-based task management design. Event semantics checking and conversion are based on a signal type system (STS) that captures both data values and service triggering. Based on the compatibility of event semantics, redundant computations in uncoordinated tasks are removed from the runtime. A prototype of Share has been experimented with a parking garage sensor network executing three uncoordinated user queries.

    :abstractText: A high spatial resolution remote sensing image provides a huge amount of data about our earth surface in more details, and makes it possible to estimate forest and tree parameters directly from aerial image. In this research the segmentation algorithm of region-merging technique was used for the identification of the individual tree crown. Fuzzy logic membership function and nearest neighbor classifier were used for the extraction of tree canopy information. The crown canopy was extracted firstly based on the multi-scale segmentation, fuzzy logic classification, and objects merge based on the class. A segmentation of tree crown mode was conducted for the individual tree crown. To get satisfying outcome, morphological reconstruction based on fuzzy logic functions, such as the feature of the area threshold and relative border to, were used to eliminate some false polygons. The results from the image-derived and field measured tree crown comparisons in this paper show that there was significant correlation, with the correlation coefficients varying from 0.69 to 0.82. Most of the tree crowns were underestimated because of the influence of shadow and crown overlap. And further research will concentrate on individual trees with little crown overlap and full rounded crowns.

    :abstractText: We present SenseWeb, an open and scalable infrastructure for sharing and geocentric exploration of sensor data streams. SenseWeb allows sensor owners to share data streams across multiple applications and users, thus amortizing sensor deployment costs effectively. It also provides mechanisms to transparently index and cache data, to process spatio-temporal queries on real-time and historic data, and to aggregate and present results on a geocentric web interface. In this paper, we present the architecture of SenseWeb, its techniques to enable global sharing of heterogeneous sensors, and its mapbased front-end for spatio-temporal data exploration. We enable interactive geocentric data exploration in the mapbased front-end using techniques for rapidly changing map overlaid visualizations of numerous data streams. We also demonstrate flexibility and scalability of the architecture by evaluating a deployed prototype of SenseWeb, which has been publicly available since March 2008.

    :abstractText: Networked embedded systems are composed of a large number of components that interact with the physical world via a set of sensors and actuators, have their own computational capabilities, and communicate with each other via a wired or wireless network. Such systems are best modeled by distributed hybrid systems that capture the interaction between the physical and computational components. Monitoring and diagnosis of any dynamical system depend crucially on the ability to estimate the system state given the observations. Estimation for distributed hybrid systems is particularly challenging because it requires keeping track of multiple models and the transitions between them. This paper presents a particle filtering based estimation algorithm for a class of distributed hybrid systems. The hybrid estimation methodology is demonstrated on a cryogenic propulsion system.

    :abstractText: Chaotic optimization is a new optimization technique. Conventional two-dimension chaotic sequence is not a good way to two-dimension gray histogram image segmentation because it is proportional distributing in [0,1] x [0,1] . In order to generate a better chaotic sequence that is fit to two-dimension gray histogram. A chaotic sequence generating method is proposed based on Arnold chaotic system and Bbzier curve generating algorithm. The main feature of the new chaotic sequence is that its distribution is approximately inside a disc whose center is (0.5,0.5), this means that the sequence is superior to Arnold chaotic sequences in image segmenting. As application, a two-dimension maximum entropy image segmentation method is presented based on chaotic optimization. Simulation results show that our method has better segmentation effect and lower computation time than the original two-dimension maximum entropy method.

    :abstractText: A sensor network data gathering and visualization infrastructure is demonstrated, comprising of Global Sensor Networks (GSN) middleware and Microsoft SensorMap. Users are invited to actively participate in the process of monitoring real-world deployments and can inspect measured data in the form of contour plots overlayed onto a high resolution map and a digital topographic model. Users can go back in time virtually to search for interesting events or simply to visualize the temporal dependencies of the data. The system presented is not only interesting and visually enticing for non-expert users but brings substantial benefits to environmental scientists. The easily installed data acquisition component as well as the powerful data sharing and visualization platform opens up new ground in collaborative data gathering and interpretation in the spirit of Web 2.0 applications.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose an effective fingerprint matching algorithm based on ridge count matching and minutiae subset combination. In the algorithm, the orientation-based ridge patterns are first utilized to remove the spuriously matched minutiae pairs. Then the reliable ridge counts between every two minutiae are estimated to improve the minutiae relationship, and finally the matched minutiae subsets corresponding to different alignments are selectively combined to reduce the influence caused by distortions in fingerprints. Experimental results on NIST-4 show that our method achieves a much better matching performance.

    :abstractText: We develop a qualitative method for understanding and representing phase space structures of complex systems. To demonstrate this method, a program called MAPS has been constructed that understands qualitatively different regions of a phase space and represents and extracts geometric shape information about these regions, using deep domain knowledge of dynamical system theory. Given a dynamical system specified as a system of governing equations, MAPS applies a successive sequence of operations to incrementally extract the qualitative information and generates a complete, high level symbolic description of the phase space structure, through a combination of numerical, combinatorial, and geometric computations and spatial reasoning techniques. The high level description is sensible to human beings and manipulable by other programs. We are currently applying the method to a difficult engineering design domain in which controllers for complex systems are to be automatically synthesized to achieve desired properties, based on the knowledge of the phase space "shapes" of the systems.

    :abstractText: This paper presents an efficient online mode estimation algorithm for a class of sensor-rich, distributed embedded systems, the so-called hybrid systems. A central problem in distributed diagnosis of hybrid systems is efficiently monitoring and tracking mode transitions. Brute-force tracking algorithms incur cost exponential in the numbers of sensors and measurements over time and are impractical for sensor-rich systems. Our algorithm uses a model of system's temporal discrete-event behavior such as a timed Petri net to generate a prior so as to focus distributed signal analysis on when and where to look for mode transition signatures of interest, drastically constraining the search for event combinations. The algorithm has been demonstrated for the online diagnosis of a hybrid system, the Xerox DC265 printer.

    :abstractText: This paper investigates the problem of designing decentralized representations to support monitoring and inferences in sensor networks. State-space models of physical phenomena such as those arising from tracking multiple interacting targets, while commonly used in signal processing and control, suffer from the curse of dimensionality as the number of phenomena of interest increases. Furthermore, mapping an inference algorithm onto a distributed sensor network must appropriately allocate scarce sensing and communication resources. We address the state-space explosion problem by developing a distributed state-space model that switches between factored and joint state spaces as appropriate. We develop a collaborative group abstraction as a mechanism to effectively support the information ow within and across subspaces of the state-space model, which can be efficiently supported in a communication-constrained network. The approach has been implemented and demonstrated in a simulation of tracking multiple interacting targets.

    :abstractText: The tradeoff between performance and scalability is a fundamental issue in distributed sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to efficiently organize and utilize network resources for target localization. Motivated by the essential role of geographic proximity in sensing, sensors are organized into geographically local collaborative groups. In a target tracking context, we present a dynamic group management method to initiate and maintain multiple tracks in a distributed manner. Collaborative groups are formed, each responsible for tracking a single target. The sensor nodes within a group coordinate their behavior using geographically-limited message passing. Mechanisms such as these for managing local collaborations are essential building blocks for scalable sensor network applications.

    :abstractText: We present mPlatform, a new reconfigurable modular sensornet platform that enables real-time processing on multiple heterogeneous processors. At the heart of the mPlatform is a scalable high-performance communication bus connecting the different modules of a node, allowing time-critical data to be shared without delay and supporting reconfigurability at the hardware level. Furthermore, the bus allows components of an application to span across different processors/modules without incurring much overhead, thus easing the program development and supporting software reconfigurability. We describe the communication architecture, protocol, and hardware configuration, and the implementation in a low power, high speed complex programmable logic device (CPLD). An asynchronous interface decouples the local processor of each module from the bus, allowing the bus to operate at the maximum desired speed while letting the processors focus on their real time tasks such as data collection and processing. Extensive experiments on the mPlatform prototype have validated the scalability of the communication architecture, and the high speed, reconfigurable inter-module communication that is achieved at the expense of a small increase in the power consumption. Finally, we demonstrate a real-time sound source localization application on the mPlatform, with four channels of acoustic data acquisition, FFT, and sound classification, that otherwise would be infeasible using traditional buses such as I2C.

    :abstractText: "Mobile phones have two sensors: a camera and a microphone. The widespread and ubiquitous nature of mobile phones around the world makes it attractive to build a large-scale sensor network using the phones as its sensor nodes. There are several interesting challenges in realizing such a system, such as providing efficient methods for the sensor nodes to make their data available to the network, allowing the sensor network applications to access the data from potentially disconnected and highly mobile devices, ensuring that privacy constraints are met, and allowing application developers to program the sensor network as required to build new applications. We demonstrate an initial system prototype that addresses some of these concerns."

    :abstractText: We study the problem of concurrently supporting multiple radios with different capabilities and interfaces on a single sensor node platform. Through a detailed experimental study on hardware multi-radio platforms, using the two representative radio technologies 802.15.4 and 802.11, we identify bottlenecks and design tradeoffs that are usually overlooked and that, as we show, have a significant impact on the sensor network's performance and energy efficiency. Our findings are threefold. We show that a proper pairing of processor and radio is crucial for taking the full advantage of the energy efficiency of higher bandwidth radios. The processor/radio pairing affects the energy balance of a sensor node, thus making the design of dynamic switching among multiple radios more challenging. Second, we demonstrate and quantify the impact of network traffic on energy consumption of a sensor node while varying network parameters, and illustrate the deficiency of existing energy-optimizing protocols. Our results indicate that by properly adjusting network parameters, such as packet size and transmission period, energy savings of upto 50\% can be achieved under heavy network traffic conditions when a CSMA-based MAC is used. Weconclude by presenting a set of guidelines for designing and implementing energy efficientmulti-radio platforms.

    :abstractText: "There are many scenarios where interoperability is required for sensor devices. We demonstrate one approach to achieve interoperability: using web services. Hosting a web service challenges the battery-life, bandwidth, and processing power constraints of low power sensor nodes. We demonstrate a lightweight implementation on MSP430 based sensor nodes with 802.15.4 radios. The implementation allows standards compliant web service clients to use the sensors but minimizes code size and energy at the sensor nodes. It allows sensor nodes to enter sleep modes. We prototype an example application for a home sensor network along with two types of sensor nodes required for it. We also show how our system enables sensor nodes to be used easily from applications written in high level languages using existing development tools."

    :abstractText: In this paper, a new universal steganalysis algorithm based on multiwavelet higher-order statistics and Support Vector Machines(SVM) is proposed. We follow the philosophy introduced in Ref[7] in which the features are calculated from the stego image's noise component in the wavelet domain. Instead of working in wavelet domain, we calculate the features in multiwavelet domain. We call this Multiwavelet Higher-Order Statistics (MHOS) feature. A nonlinear SVM classifier is then trained on a database of images to construct a universal steganalyzer. The comparison to the current state-of-the-art universal steganalyzers, which was performed on the same image databases under the same testing conditions, indicates that the proposed universal steganalysis offers improved performance.

    :abstractText: "Easy management and maintenance and highly cost effective equipment make Ethernet an attractive technology for deploying Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). However, Ethernet has poor scalability due to use flat addressing scheme. To make Metro-Ethernet more scalable, the Provider Edge (PE) nodes can use MAC-in-MAC (MiM) encapsulation scheme for frame forwarding. The MiM encapsulation scheme reduces the forwarding table size in the Core Nodes (CNs), but not in the PE nodes which need to maintain the entries of mapping end user\xE2\x80\x99s MAC address to PE\xE2\x80\x99s MAC address. In this paper, we propose an End user enabled MAC-in-MAC (EMiM) encapsulation scheme for Metro-Ethernet. In the proposed scheme, a user\xE2\x80\x99s MAC address as well as its PE node\xE2\x80\x99s MAC address are associated with its Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) entry. The modified ARP entry allows the end user to do MiM encapsulation. Hence a PE node does not need to maintain the entries of mapping end user\xE2\x80\x99s MAC address to PE node\xE2\x80\x99s MAC address, thus significantly reducing the forwarding table size. The proposed scheme sustains Ethernet\xE2\x80\x99s plug-and-play feature and provides high scalability. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can reduce up to 65% maximum forwarding table size in PE nodes."

    :abstractText: Location knowledge of nodes in a network is essential for many tasks such as routing, cooperative sensing, or service delivery in ad hoc, mobile, or sensor networks. This paper introduces a novel iterative method ILS for node localization starting with a relatively small number of anchor nodes in a large network. At each iteration, nodes are localized using a least-squares based algorithm. The computation is lightweight, fast, and any-time. To prevent error from propagating and accumulating during the iteration, the error control mechanism of the algorithm uses an error registry to select nodes that participate in the localization, based on their relative contribution to the localization accuracy. Simulation results have shown that the active selection strategy significantly mitigates the effect of error propagation. The algorithm has been tested on a network of Berkeley Mica2 motes with ultrasound TOA ranging devices. We have compared the algorithm with more global methods such as MDS-MAP and SDP-based algorithm both in simulation and on real hardware. The iterative localization achieves comparable location accuracy in both cases, compared to the more global methods, and has the advantage of being fully decentralized.

    :abstractText: A practical pricing mechanism is the foundation for the deploying of IP multicast in the inter-domain Internet. The IP multicast service model and its pricing mechanism are discussed in this paper, by considering the motivations of different partners in the process. A model named ICP-ISPs is proposed for applications in the real environments. In this model, the applied scenarios, resolving method and the complexity of algorithm are described. Here, the Internet is considered as an ecosystem. So our work gives a general discussion on the practical pricing mechanism based on the game theory for the stability of the economic development in the Internet.

    :abstractText: This paper focuses on the design of IBGP networks, which are very important to the reliability and stability of Internet. Although several metrics have been presented to measure the robustness of IBGP networks, they only considered the impact of route reflection networks on the control plane. A robust network should have low sensitivity to traffic load variations. So we propose a new metric to characterize the impact of route reflection networks on the data plane, which is called TDR (Traffic Diversion Rate). Simulation results show that adopting the optimal route reflection topology that minimizes TDR will make the network lose or shift much less traffic, compared with adopting the optimal route reflection topologies found according to other metrics.

    :abstractText: Energy consumption in hosting Internet services is becoming a pressing issue as these services scale up. Dynamic server provisioning techniques are effective in turning off unnecessary servers to save energy. Such techniques, mostly studied for request-response services, face challenges in the context of connection servers that host a large number of long-lived TCP connections. In this paper, we characterize unique properties, performance, and power models of connection servers, based on a real data trace collected from the deployed Windows Live Messenger. Using the models, we design server provisioning and load dispatching algorithms and study subtle interactions between them. We show that our algorithms can save a significant amount of energy without sacrificing user experiences.

    :abstractText: Despite significant progress in recent years, ab initio folding is still one of the most challenging problems in structural biology. This paper presents a probabilistic graphical model for ab initio folding, which employs Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and directional statistics to model the relationship between the primary sequence of a protein and its three-dimensional structure. Different from the widely-used fragment assembly method and the lattice model for protein folding, our graphical model can explore protein conformations in a continuous space according to their probability. The probability of a protein conformation reflects its stability and is estimated from PSI-BLAST sequence profile and predicted secondary structure. Experimental results indicate that this new method compares favorably with the fragment assembly method and the lattice model.

    :abstractText: Networked embedded systems such as wireless sensor networks are usually designed to be event-driven so that they are reactive and power efficient. Programming embedded systems with multiple reactive tasks is difficult due to the complex nature of managing the concurrency of execution threads and consistency of shared states. This paper describes a globally asynchronous and locally synchronous model (TinyGALS) for programming event-driven embedded systems. Software components are composed locally through synchronous method calls to form modules, and asynchronous message passing is used between modules to separate the flow of control. In addition, a guarded yet synchronous model (TinyGUYS) is designed to allow thread-safe sharing of global state by multiple modules without explicitly passing messages. This programming model is structured such that all asynchronous message passing code and module triggering mechanisms can be automatically generted from a high-level specification. We have implemented the programming model and code generation facilities on a wireless sensor network platform known as the Berkeley motes. As an example, we have redesigned a multi-hop ad hoc communication protocol using the TinyGALS model.

    :abstractText: We present a web service based approach to enable an evolutionary sensornet system where additional sensor nodes may be added after the initial deployment. The functionality and data provided by the new nodes is exposed in a structured manner, so that multiple applications may access them. The result is a highly inter-operable system where multiple applications can share a common evolving sensor substrate. A key challenge in using web services on resource constrained sensor nodes is the energy and bandwidth overhead of the structured data formats used in web services. Our work provides a detailed evaluation of the overheads and presents an implementation on a representative sensor platform with 48k of ROM, 10k of RAM and a 802.15.4 radio. We identify design choices that optimize the web service operation on resource constrained sensor nodes, including support for low latency messaging and sleep modes, quantifying trade-offs between the design generality and resource efficiency. We also prototyped an example application, for home energy management, demonstrating how evolutionary sensor networks can be supported with our approach.

    :abstractText: "IP routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) or BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), have many configurable parameters (e.g., timers) and interact with each other in complex ways. Network operators may need to explore numerous candidate configuration changes before identifying a choice. In this paper, from the point of view of the economics of the Internet backbone, we propose a potential profit loss metric to evaluate configurations. Then we focus on analyzing the potential profit loss caused by link state changes under different configurations. We give quantitative relations between the potential profit loss and the major influential factors: OSPF timers, BGP timers and failure duration. From the quantitative relations we can see that appropriate configurations can reduce the profit loss much."

    :abstractText: "In a sensor network, data routing is tightly coupled to the needs of a sensing task, and hence the application semantics. This paper introduces the novel idea of information-directed routing, in which routing is formulated as a joint optimization of data transport and information aggregation. The routing objective is to minimize communication cost while maximizing information gain, differing from routing considerations for more general ad hoc networks. The paper uses the concrete problem of locating and tracking possibly moving signal sources as an example of information generation processes, and considers two common information extraction patterns in a sensor network: routing a user query from an arbitrary entry node to the vicinity of signal sources and back, or to a prespecified exit node, maximizing information accumulated along the path. We derive information constraints from realistic signal models, and present several routing algorithms that find near-optimal solutions for the joint optimization problem. Simulation results have demonstrated that information-directed routing is a significant improvement over a previously reported greedy algorithm, as measured by sensing quality such as localization and tracking accuracy and communication quality such as success rate in routing around sensor holes."

    :abstractText: Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) has been an effective tool to detect and prevent unwanted attempts, which are mainly through network and system vulnerabilities, at accessing and manipulating computer systems. Intrusion detection and prevention are two main functions of IPS. As attacks are becoming massive and complex, the traditional centralized IPSes are incapable of detecting all those attempts. The existing distributed IPSes, mainly based on mobile agent, have some serious problems, such as weak security of mobile agents, response latency, large code size. In this paper, we propose a customized intrusion prevention system, VMFence, in distributed virtual computing environment to simplify the complexity of the management. In VMFence, the states of detection processes vary with those of Virtual Machines (VMs), which are described by Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). The detection processes, each of which detects one virtual machine, reside in a privileged virtual machine. The processes run synchronously and outside of VMs in order to achieve high performance and security. The experimental results also show VMFence has higher detection efficiency than traditional intrusion detection systems and little impact on the performance of the monitored VMs.

    :abstractText: "The test system in this essay is a test system under the mode of B/S (Browser/Server). In the test system, the subjective item grading technology is always a problem that limits the computer scoring technology development. The subjective items generally require to answer the questions in a way of language description, Since different person has different way of thinking, different level of understanding and different way of describing, the answers cannot be unanimously the same. Here we'll use the XML DOM object to do some research on the subjective item scoring problem. Solving the type of subjective items that has no unanimously same answers, such as short-answer questions, discussion questions etc. There are two factors that will affect the subjective item scoring: knowledge point and the nearness level. The uni-directional nearness algorithm in the fuzzy mathematics only focus on the keyword matching, but ignore the scoring of the knowledge point and the nearness level of the whole question's answering. First we'll analyses the DOM tree's structure and the tree model, research the use of the navigation document tree, DOM tree object, attribute data's reading and DOM tree DFS(depth first search) traversal method. And then discuss and build a automated scroing system's workflow based on XML DOM tree. Design a scoring system algorithm that can solve the short-answer, discussion-question kind of subjective items problem."

    :abstractText: In virtual machine (VM) systems, mandatory access control (MAC) enforcement is possible now. This technique is both stronger and more flexible than traditional VM isolation, even if network communication is controlled. Unfortunately all of the VM systems with the MAC enforcement does not consider that the MAC controls may be distorted by covert channels, which constitute an important risk in VM systems. Traditional MAC models have difficulties being enforced to reduce the risk of covert flows in VM systems due to the many constraints and the lack of flexibility. In this paper, we identify access control requirements for managing covert channels in VM systems through a critical analysis of the ways by which classical models constrain the covert information flows and we propose a model called the Prioritized Chinese Wall model (PCW) to reduce the risk of covert flows in VM systems while preserving the flexibility. Furthermore, we enforce the policy in sHype/Xen VM system.

    :abstractText: Many important science and engineering applications, such as regulating the temperature distribution over a semi conductor wafer and controlling the noise from a photocopy machine, require interpreting distributed data and designing decentralized controllers for spatially distributed systems. Developing effective computational techniques for representing and reasoning about these systems, which are usually modeled with partial differential equations (PDEs) , is one of the major challenge problems for qualitative and spatial reasoning research.

    :abstractText: Reasoning about spatial data is a key task in many applications, including geographic information systems, meteorological and fluid-flow analysis, computer-aided design, and protein structure databases. Such applications often require the identification and manipulation of qualitative spatial representations, for example, to detect whether one object will soon occlude another in a digital image or efficiently determine relationships between a proposed road and wetland regions in a geographic data set. Qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) provides representational primitives (a spatial "vocabulary") and inference mechanisms for these tasks. This article first reviews representative work on QSR for data-poor scenarios, where the goal is to design representations that can answer qualitative queries without much numeric information. It then turns to the data-rich case, where the goal is to derive and manipulate qualitative spatial representations that efficiently and correctly abstract important spatial aspects of the underlying data for use in subsequent tasks. This article focuses on how a particular QSR system, SPATIAL AGGREGATION, can help answer spatial queries for scientific and engineering data sets. A case study application of weather analysis illustrates the effective representation and reasoning supported by both data-poor and data-rich forms of QSR.

    :abstractText: Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers - kam, maps, and hipair - in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.

Human experts often understand and verbalize the regularities as abstract spatial objects evolving coherently and interacting with each other in the domain space. We describe a novel computational approach for identifying and extracting these abstract spatial objects through the construction of a hierarchy of spatial relations. We demonstrate the approach with an application to finding pressure trough features in weather data sets.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose to use the fingerprint valley instead of ridge for the binarization-thinning process to extract fingerprint minutiae. We first use several preprocessing steps on the binary image in order to eliminate the spurious lakes and dots, and to reduce the spurious islands, bridges, and spurs in the skeleton image. By removing all the bug pixels introduced at the thinning stage, our algorithm can detect a maximum number of minutiae from the fingerprint skeleton using the Rutovitz Crossing Number. This allows the true minutiae preserved and false minutiae removed in later postprocessing stages. Finally, using the intrinsic duality property of fingerprint image we develop several postprocessing techniques to efficiently remove spurious minutiae. Especially, we define an H-point structure to remove several types of spurious minutiae including bridge, triangle, ladder, and wrinkle all together. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithms.

    :abstractText: RACNet is a sensor network for monitoring a data center's environmental conditions. The high spatial and temporal fidelity measurements that RACNet provides can be used to improve the data center's safety and energy efficiency. RACNet overcomes the network's large scale and density and the data center's harsh RF environment to achieve data yields of 99% or higher over a wide range of network sizes and sampling frequencies. It does so through a novel Wireless Reliable Acquisition Protocol (WRAP). WRAP decouples topology control from data collection and implements a token passing mechanism to provide network-wide arbitration. This congestion avoidance philosophy is conceptually different from existing congestion control algorithms that retroactively respond to congestion. Furthermore, WRAP adaptively distributes nodes among multiple frequency channels to balance load and lower data latency. Results from two testbeds and an ongoing production data center deployment indicate that RACNet outperforms previous data collection systems, especially as network load increases.

    :abstractText: The Development of effective content-based 3D model retrieval and classification is still an important research issue due to the growing amount of digital information, this paper present a novel 3D model retrieval and classification algorithm. In feature representation, a method combining distance histogram and moment invariants is proposed to improve the retrieval performance. A major advantage of the distance histogram is its invariance to the transforms of scaling, translation and rotation. Based on the premise that two similar images should have high mutual information, or equivalently, the querying image should convey high information about those similar to it, this paper proposed a mutual information distance measure to perform the similarity comparison. Multi-class support vector machine performs the classification for it has a very good generalization performance. This paper tested the algorithm with a 3D model retrieval and classification prototype, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the satisfactory retrieval results and good classification accuracy.

    :abstractText: "Adaboost algorithm for face detection in real-time is difficult to implement due to its significant computational complexity and memory requirements in terms of stringent memory bandwidth and huge memory volume. In this paper, we present two aspects of improvements in implementing the Adaboost algorithm, i.e. platform specific optimization on a DSP platform (TI\xE2\x80\x99s TMS320DM642); and algorithm specific optimization including optimized cascade training, floating-point to fixed-point conversion (FFC) and scaling image. In the process of platform specific optimization, software pipeline, loop unrolling and writing liner assembly code is fulfilled. With these enhancements, we show in experimental results that the implemented system can detect human faces in real-time at a frame rate of 25 fps with little loss of correct detection rate. In our implementation, we further decrease the false detection rate, and dramatically reduce memory bandwidth and memory size required."

    :abstractText: The classic wavelet transform has been applied in registration and fusion of medical images for decades. An extension namely, contourlet transform recently indicated its advantages in image fusion with better efficiency in multi-resolution and multi-direction representation and calculation. However, the even higher computational complexity it requires turns out to be a disastrous concern in embedded applications. In this paper, we implement an acceleration system on a heterogeneous TI Da Vinci dual core processor consisting of an ARM processor core and a DSP processor core. The ARM core controls the fusion procedure by extracting the luminance bits and invoking the DSP core to carry out the time-consuming part of the contourlet transform. The partitions of tasks are determined after the program is analyzed and profiled at functional level to make full use of the computational capability of the heterogeneous platform. Initial measured improved performance results are obtained and analyzed with projected further improvements.

    :abstractText: With the development of speech recognition, speech data mining becomes a hot topic in fields of data mining and natural language processing. In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm is presented to describe how to do semantic mining and how to understand the developing trend of event implied in speech sequence. At first, the speech sequences are extracted into a Baysian network presenting the relationship between different speech elements. Then, we utilize a 3-dimensional space and sequence cluster techniques to excavate implied information from speech. Considering speech data features, we improve traditional distance-based clustering algorithm to get semantic information and enhance performance. The experimental results show that our algorithm is correct and effective.

    :abstractText: Because of the wide deployment of 802.11 equipments in the past decade, current applications are not limited anymore to only single access points (AP) deployments for indoor usage, but have been extended to multi-hop networks to fulfill the need of high speed connectivity in mobile environments, where the analysis of multi-hop networks is extremely complicated. The behavior of an AP is dependent not only on its neighborspsila behavior, but also on the behavior of other hidden nodes. In this paper, we provide an accurate and verified multi-hop wireless backhaul analysis for performance of IEEE 802.11 DCF in terms of the channel throughput using a static channel error rate. The model is based on analysis of a single hop communications for evaluating the multi-hop wireless backhaul networks. We utilized our existing 3.5-mile Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) test bed on the BNSF railroad track in Nebraska to validate the model. Our field measurements and simulation results show that our proposed model is accurate.

    :abstractText: Many image analysis tasks require an outlier detection procedure to identify the false matches. In this paper, a fast and effective outlier detection method is presented to match images in the uncalibrated case. This method employs a hypothesis test on the consistency of dominant orientations of the feature points to significantly increase the detection speed. Moreover, it can also effectively find the outliers that can not be identified by traditional RANSAC-based methods using epipolar constraint. Note that our method does not require the prior knowledge of camera parameters or the percentage of outliers. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the classical RANSAC-based methods both in speed and in accuracy of the results.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we propose a feature-based registration algorithm for the confocal fluorescence images captured by an endomicroscopy system. We first extract a number of feature points from the endomicroscopy images by applying the binarization-thinning process and using the Rutovitz crossing number. These feature points are then post-processed to eliminate the spurious ones. After that we use the purified feature points to complete the image registration between every two consecutive slice images. The aligned image stack will be finally utilized to reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of the living cell and tissue in real time, which provides the opportunity for the clinicians to diagnose various diseases including the early-stage cancers.

    :abstractText: Seamless image processing concerns stitching parts of images in a visually natural manner. In this paper, we present a seamless processing method which unifies Featuring, Optimal seam method [1] and some recent gradient domain methods including Poisson image editing [2], Drag-and-drop pasting [3] and GIST [4]. To evaluate the processing quality visually, a variational energy function is proposed to compute both the similarity of the stitched image to each of the input images and the visibility of the seam between the stitched images. The minimum of the energy function gives a globally consistent composition in both geometrical and photometric structures. Based on 3 propositions, we study the energy function and compare it with other methods theoretically. The experimental results show the benefits of our stitching method.

    :abstractText: Plankton image classification plays an important role in ocean biological research. In this paper, we present an approach based on the bagging technique to classify the marine plankton images captured by the Shadowed Image Particle Profiling and Evaluation Recorder. The difficulty of such classification is multifold because the data set is much noisier, and the plankton images are deformable, projection-variant, and often in partial occlusion. In addition, the images in our experiments are binary, thus are lack of pixel-depth information. By random sampling with replacement on the original training set, a number of independent bootstrap replicates are generated. Using these replicates as new training sets, we construct multiple classifiers that are complementary of one another. While such individual classifiers are less effective than a single classifier trained on the whole training set, the fusion of them using majority voting produces an improved tenfold cross-validation accuracy by more than 93%.

    :abstractText: Recent works have shown the usefulness of network and application layer protocols that connect low power sensor nodes directly to multiple applications and users on the Internet. We propose a security solution for this scenario. While previous works have provided security support for various communication patterns in sensor networks, such as among nodes, from nodes to a base station, and from users to nodes, the security of communication from sensor nodes to multiple users has not been sufficiently addressed. Specifically, we explore this design space and develop a security solution, named Secure-TWS, for efficient authentication of data sent by a resource constrained sensor node to multiple users, using digital signatures. We investigate the resource overheads in communication and computation for two most suitable signature schemes - the Elliptic Curve Digital Algorithm (ECDSA) and the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) short signature schemes. We implement these schemes on two popular sensor node architectures (based onMSP430 and ARM processors with 802.15.4 radios) and experimentally characterize relevant trade-offs.

    :abstractText: Mobile applications often need location data, to update locally relevant information and adapt the device context. While most smartphones do include a GPS receiver, it's frequent use is restricted due to high battery drain. We design and prototype an adaptive location service for mobile devices, a-Loc, that helps reduce this battery drain. Our design is based on the observation that the required location accuracy varies with location, and hence lower energy and lower accuracy localization methods, such as those based on WiFi and cell-tower triangulation, can sometimes be used. Our method automatically determines the dynamic accuracy requirement for mobile search-based applications. As the user moves, both the accuracy requirements and the location sensor errors change. A-Loc continually tunes the energy expenditure to meet the changing accuracy requirements using the available sensors. A Bayesian estimation framework is used to model user location and sensor errors. Experiments are performed with Android G1 and AT&T Tilt phones, on paths that include outdoor and indoor locations, using war-driving data from Google and Microsoft. The experiments show that a-Loc not only provides significant energy savings, but also improves the accuracy achieved, because it uses multiple sensors.

    :abstractText: This paper derives energy-optimal batching periodsfor asynchronous multistage data processing on sensor nodes in the sense of minimizing energy consumption while meeting end-to-end deadlines. Batching the processing of (sensor) data maximizes processor sleep periods, hence minimizing the wakeup frequency and the corresponding overhead. The algorithm is evaluated on mPlatform, a next-generation heterogeneous sensor node platform equipped with both a low-end microcontroller(MSP430) and a higher-end embedded systems processor (ARM). Experimental results show that the total energy consumption of mPlatform, when processing data flowsat their optimal batching periods, is up to 35% lower than that for uniform period assignment. Moreover, processing data at the appropriate processor can use as much as 80% less energy than running the same task set on the ARM alone and 25% less energy than running the taskset on the MSP430 alone.

    :abstractText: With the development of virtualization technology, file protection in virtual machine, especially in guest OS, becomes more and more important. Traditional host-based file protection system resides the critical modules in monitored system, which is easily explored and destroyed by malwares. Moreover, in order to protect the multiple operation systems running on the same platform, it is necessary to install independent file protection system for each of them, which greatly wastes computing resources and brings serious performance overhead. In this paper, a novel VM-based real-time file protection system, named VRFPS, is proposed to solve these problems. First, virtual machine monitor introspects all file operations of guest OS. Then, semantic gap between disk block and logic files is narrowed by blktap. Finally, a virtual sandbox is implemented in privileged domain to prevent protected files in guest domain from modifying illegally. Our approach is highly isolated, transparent and without modification on virtual machine monitor and guest OS. The experimental results show that the presented system is validate and of low performance overhead.

    :abstractText: Computing preference queries has received a lot of attention in the database community. It is common that the user is unsure of his/her preference, so care must be taken to elicit the preference of the user correctly. In this paper, we propose to elicit the preferred ordering of a user by utilizing skyline objects as the representatives of the possible ordering. We introduce the notion of order-based representative skylines which selects representatives based on the orderings that they represent. To further facilitate preference exploration, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to compute a denogram on the skyline objects. By coupling the hierarchical clustering with visualization techniques, we allow users to refine their preference weight settings by browsing the hierarchy. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results validate the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach.

    :abstractText: Virtualization is often used in cloud computing platforms for its several advantages in efficiently managing resources. However, virtualization raises certain additional challenges, and one of them is lack of power metering for virtual machines (VMs). Power management requirements in modern data centers have led to most new servers providing power usage measurement in hardware and alternate solutions exist for older servers using circuit and outlet level measurements. However, VM power cannot be measured purely in hardware. We present a solution for VM power metering, named Joulemeter. We build power models to infer power consumption from resource usage at runtime and identify the challenges that arise when applying such models for VM power metering. We show how existing instrumentation in server hardware and hypervisors can be used to build the required power models on real platforms with low error. Our approach is designed to operate with extremely low runtime overhead while providing practically useful accuracy. We illustrate the use of the proposed metering capability for VM power capping, a technique to reduce power provisioning costs in data centers. Experiments are performed on server traces from several thousand production servers, hosting Microsoft's real-world applications such as Windows Live Messenger. The results show that not only does VM power metering allows virtalized data centers to achieve the same savings that non-virtualized data centers achieved through physical server power capping, but also that it enables further savings in provisioning costs with virtualization.

    :abstractText: "Motivation: One of the major bottlenecks with ab initio protein folding is an effective conformation sampling algorithm that can generate native-like conformations quickly. The popular fragment assembly method generates conformations by restricting the local conformations of a protein to short structural fragments in the PDB. This method may limit conformations to a subspace to which the native fold does not belong because (i) a protein with really new fold may contain some structural fragments not in the PDB and (ii) the discrete nature of fragments may prevent them from building a native-like fold. Previously we have developed a conditional random fields (CRF) method for fragment-free protein folding that can sample conformations in a continuous space and demonstrated that this CRF method compares favorably to the popular fragment assembly method. However, the CRF method is still limited by its capability of generating conformations compatible with a sequence. Results: We present a new fragment-free approach to protein folding using a recently invented probabilistic graphical model conditional neural fields (CNF). This new CNF method is much more powerful than CRF in modeling the sophisticated protein sequence-structure relationship and thus, enables us to generate native-like conformations more easily. We show that when coupled with a simple energy function and replica exchange Monte Carlo simulation, our CNF method can generate decoys much better than CRF on a variety of test proteins including the CASP8 free-modeling targets. In particular, our CNF method can predict a correct fold for T0496_D1, one of the two CASP8 targets with truly new fold. Our predicted model for T0496 is significantly better than all the CASP8 models. Contact: jinboxu@gmail.com"

    :abstractText: Downside loss-averse preferences have seen a resurgence in the portfolio management literature. This is due to the increasing use of derivatives in managing equity portfolios and the increased use of quantitative techniques for bond portfolio management. We employ the lower partial moment as a risk measure for downside loss aversion and compare mean-variance (M-V) and mean-lower partial moment (M-LPM) optimal portfolios under nonnormal asset return distributions. When asset returns are nearly normally distributed, there is little difference between the optimal M-V and M-LPM portfolios. When asset returns are nonnormal with large left tails, we document significant differences in M-V and M-LPM optimal portfolios. This observation is consistent with industry usage of M-V theory for equity portfolios but not for fixed-income portfolios.

    :abstractText: Temporal reasoning can be performed by maintaining a temporal relation network, a complete network in which the nodes are time intervals and each arc is the temporal relation between the two intervals which it connects. In this paper, we point out that the task of detecting inconsistency of the network and mapping the intervals onto a date line is a Consistent Labeling Problem (CLP). The problem is formalized and analyzed. The significance of identifying and analyzing the CLP in temporal reasoning is that CLPs have certain features which allow us to apply certain techniques to our problem. We also point out that the CLP exists when we reason with disjunctive temporal relations. Therefore, the intractability of the constraint propagation mechanism in temporal reasoning is inherent in the problem, not caused by the representation that we choose for time, as [Vilain & Kautz 86] claims.

It involves the construction of a substantial, carefully specified, fully tested and fully operational system. The software engineering aspect of Constraint-Satisfaction is emphasized in this paper. Constraint-Satisfaction problems are expressed in a language more familiar to the formal software engineering community. This brings Constraint-Satisfaction one step closer to formal specification, program verification and transformation; issues extensively studied in software engineering. In problem formulation, explicit domain constraints and heuristic information are made explicit. Moreover, the user's needs are considered more closely; for instance, when the program fails to find a solution, useful indications are produced to help in relaxation or reformulation of the problem."

    :abstractText: Optimization in changing environment is a challenging task, especially when multiple objectives are to be optimized simultaneously. The basic idea to address dynamic optimization problems is to utilize history information to guide future search. In this paper, two strategies for population re-initialization are introduced when a change in the environment is detected. The first strategy is to predict the new location of individuals from the location changes that have occurred in the history. The current population is then partially or completely replaced by the new individuals generated based on prediction. The second strategy is to perturb the current population with a Gaussian noise whose variance is estimated according to previous changes. The prediction based population re-initialization strategies, together with the random re-initialization method, are then compared on two bi-objective test problems. Conclusions on the different re-initialization strategies are drawn based on the preliminary empirical results.

    :abstractText: Multiobjective optimization problems with many local Pareto fronts is a big challenge to evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, two operators, biased initialization and biased crossover, are proposed to improve the global search ability of RM-MEDA, a recently proposed multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithm. Biased initialization inserts several globally Pareto optimal solutions into the initial population; biased crossover combines the location information of some best solutions found so far and globally statistical information extracted from current population. Experiments have been conducted to study the effects of these two operators.

    :abstractText: BT workforce scheduling problem considers technicians (with different skills) which are assigned to tasks which arrive (partially) dynamically during the day. In order to manage their workforce, BT divides the different regions into several areas. In the beginning of each day all the technicians in a region are assigned to one of these areas. During the day, tasks can only be allocated to technicians from the same area. In this paper we use a (1+1) EA in order to decide, once the area have been defined, which technicians to assign to which areas.

    :abstractText: Recently Dent and Mercer have introduced an algorithm called minimal forward checking (MFC) which always performs no worse than forward checking (FC) in terms of number of compatibility checks and node expanded given the same variable and value orderings. In this paper we describe an algorithm which extends MFC with backmarking and conflict-directed backtracking. The new algorithm has a smaller space complexity' than MFC. Experiments were conducted to compare it with MFC and some regular FC based algorithms. The results show that the new algorithm always performs at least as good as its "non-lazy" counterpart. It outperforms MFC on average and its edge over MFC is particularly clear for problems near to phase transitions. Interestingly, the minimum width variable ordering heuristic appears to be a better choice than the fail-first heuristic for the new algorithm in many occasions, particularly for sparsely constrainedproblems.

    :abstractText: The Processor Configuration Problem (PCP) is a Constraint Optimization Problem. The task is to link up a finite set of processors into a network, while minimizing the maximum distance between these processors. Since each processor has a limited number of communication channels, a carefully planned layout could minimize the overhead for message switching. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach to the PCP. Our technique uses a mutation based GA, a function that produces schemata by analyzing previous solutions, and an effective data representation. Our approach has been shown to out-perform other published techniques in this problem.

    :abstractText: Tims has been studied by logicians for a long time and recently it has been modelled in more and more researches in AI. There exists a gap between the logics built by temporal logicians and those used in AI. This paper aims at filing this gap and providing a formal study on temporal logics for AI. In this paper, we present a new axiomatization of Allen & Hayes' temporal logic and locate their logic in the spectrum of logics built by temporal logicians. We also relate point-, event- and interval-based time structures to one another.

    :abstractText: Designers of racing cars and aeroplanes today would typically put their designs through wind-tunnel testing. Many business strategies determine the success or failure of an enterprise. It is sensible to put these strategies into action before testing them rigorously. On the other hand, new markets are being designed all the time; examples include the electricity market and traffic markets. The robustness and efficiency of these market affect the society. It is inconceivable to put these markets into operation without testing them scientifically (e.g. to ask what-if questions). Agent-based market modeling allows one to "wind-tunnel test" strategies and market designs. No model is perfect, and no amount of testing will guarantee the success of a strategy or market. However, agent-based models enable us to test complex behavior and their interactions. In this talk, I shall define the research agenda, and explain some of the work that we have done in wind-tunnel testing strategies and market designs. Applications include automated bargaining and BT's work force scheduling.

It shows better performance than most nowadays mainstream MOEA methods in various test problems, especially on the quality of solution's distribution in the Pareto set. This paper aims to bring the strength of metamodel into MOEA/D to help the solving of expensive black-box multi-objective problems. Gaussian Random Field Metamodel(GRFM) is chosen as the approximation method. The performance is analysed and compared on several test problems, which shows a promising perspective on this method.

    :abstractText: Constraint satisfaction has become an important field in computer science. This technology is embedded in millions of pounds of software used by major companies. Many researchers or software engineers in the industry could have benefited from using constraint technology without realizing it. The aim of this paper is to promote constraint technology by providing readers with a fairly quick introduction to this field. The approach here is to use the well known 8-queens problem to illustrate the basic techniques in constraint satisfaction (without going into great details), and leave interested readers with pointers to further study this field.

    :abstractText: "This paper presents an evolutionary algorithms based constrain-guided method (CGM) that is capable of handling both hard and soft constraints in optimization problems. While searching for constraint-satisfied solutions, the method differentiates candidate solutions by assigning them with different fitness values, enabling favorite solutions to be distinguished more likely and more effectively from unfavored ones. We illustrate the use of CGM in solving two economic problems with optimization involved: (1) searching equilibriums for bargaining problems; (2) reducing the rate of failure in financial prediction problems. The efficacy of the proposed CGM is analyzed and compared with some other computational techniques, including a repair method and a penalty method for the problem (1), a linear classifier and three neural networks for the problem (2), respectively. Our studies here suggest that the evolutionary algorithms based CGM compares favorably against those computational approaches."

    :abstractText: Much research effort has been applied to finding effective ways for solving constraint satisfaction problems. However, the most fundamental aspect of constraint satisfaction problem solving, problem formulation, has received much less attention. This is important because the selection of an appropriate formulation can have dramatic effects on the efficiency of any constraint satisfaction problem solving algorithm.In this paper, we address the issue of problem formulation. We identify the heuristic nature of generating a good formulation and we propose a context for this process. Our work presents the research community with a focus for the many elements which affect problem formulation and this is illustrated with the example adding redundant constraints. It also provides a significant step towards the goal of automatic selection of problem formulations.

    :abstractText: We report on a method that uses spatio-temporal reasoning to schedule aircraft to take-off positions. The objective is to aid human controllers to detect potential conflicts which could cause hazards or delays. The challenge is to develop temporal-spatial reasoning systems that can handle complex and dynamic situations so that their results help the controllers to instruct the aircraft to move smoothly until they take off. Optimisation is secondary and sometimes not easy to measure. Although the proposed method was developed with the aircraft domain in mind, it could be applied to order the movements of interacting objects that have both expected paths and destination times (i.e., &rsquo;&rsquo;achieve this goal, at this place, at this time&lsquo;&lsquo;).

    :abstractText: The Guided Genetic Algorithm (GCA) is a hybrid of Genetic Algorithm and Guided Local Search, a meta-heuristic search algorithm. As the search progresses, GGA modifies both the fitness function and fitness template of candidate solutions based on feedback from constraints. The fitness template is then used to bias crossover and mutation. The Radio Link Frequency Assignment Problem (RLFAP) is a class of problem that has practical relevance to both military and civil applications. In this paper, we show how GGA can be applied to the RLFAP. We focus on an abstraction of a real life military application that involves the assigning of frequencies to radio links. GGA was tested on a set of eleven benchmark problems provided by the French military. This set of problems has been studied intensively by a number of prominent groups in Europe. It covers a variety of needs in military applications, including the satisfaction of constraints, finding optimal solutions that satisfy all the constraints and optimization of some objective functions whenever no solution exist (&ldquo;partial constraint satisfaction&rdquo;). Not only do these benchmark problems vary in problem nature, they are reasonably large for military applications (up to 916 variables, and up to 5548 constraints). This makes them a serious challenge to the generality, reliability as well as efficiency of algorithms. We show in this paper that GGA is capable of producing excellent results reliably in the whole set of benchmark problems.

    :abstractText: Evolutionary Dynamic Data Investment Evaluator (EDDIE) is a genetic programming (GP)-based decision support tool for financial forecasting. EDDIE itself does not replace forecasting experts. It serves to improve the productivity of experts in searching the space of decision trees, with the aim to improve the odds in its user's favour. The efficacy of EDDIE has been reported in the literature. However, discovering patterns in historical data is only the first step towards building a practical financial forecasting tool. Data preparation, rules organization and application are all important issues. This paper describes an architecture that embeds EDDIE for learning from and monitoring the stock market.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we show how Guided Local Search (GLS) can be applied to the SAT problem and show how the resulting algorithm can be naturally extended to solve the weighted MAX-SAT problem. GLS is a general, penalty-based meta-heuristic, which sits on top of local search algorithms to help guide them out of local minima. GLS has been shown to be successful in solving a number of practical real-life problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, BT"s workforce scheduling problem, the radio link frequency assignment problem, and the vehicle routing problem. We present empirical results of applying GLS to instances of the SAT problem from the DIMACS archive and also a small set of weighted MAX-SAT problem instances and compare them with the results of other local search algorithms for the SAT problem.

    :abstractText: This paper is about business modelling and negotiation protocol design in distributed scheduling, where individual agents have individual (potentially conflicting) interests. It is motivated by BT's workforce scheduling problem, in which multiple service providers have to serve multiple service buyers. The service providers and buyers all attempt to maximize their own utility. The overall problem is a multi-objective optimization problem; for example, one has to maximize completion rates and service quality and minimize travelling distances. Although the work is motivated by BT's business operations, the aim is to develop a general negotiation protocol for staff empowerment. Standard contract net is a practical strategy in distributed scheduling where agents may have conflicting objectives. In this paper, we have introduced a retractable contract net protocol, RECONNET, which supports hill-climbing in the space of schedules. It is built upon a job-release and compensation mechanism. A system based on RECONNET has been implemented for BT's workforce scheduling problem. The software, which we call ASMCR, allows the management to exert full control over the company's multiple objectives. The manager generates a Pareto set of solutions by defining, for each buyer and seller, the weights given to each objective. ASMCR gives service buyers and sellers ownership of their problem and freedom to maximize their performance under the criteria defined by the management. ASMCR was tested on real-sized problems and demonstrated to meet BT's operational time requirement. It has full potential to be further developed for tackling BT's workforce scheduling problem.

    :abstractText: The aim of this work is to detect important movements in financial stock prices that may indicate future opportunities or risks. The occurrence of such movements is scarce, thus this problem falls into the domain of Chance Discovery, a new research area whose objective is to identify rare events that may represent potential opportunities and risks. In this work we propose to capture patterns of the rare instances in different ways in order to increase the probability of identifying similar cases in the future. To generate more variety of solutions we evolve a genetic program, which is an evolutionary technique that is able to create multiple solutions for a single problem. The idea is to mine the knowledge acquired by the evolutionary process to extract and collect different rules that model the positive cases in several and novel ways. Once an important movement in financial markets has been discovered, human interaction is needed to analyze the markets conditions and determine if that movement could be a good opportunity to invest or could be the principle of a bubble or another critical event that represents a risk. Standard decision trees methods capture patterns from training data sets. However, when the chances are scare, some of the patters captured by the best rules may not repeat themselves in unseen cases. In this work we propose Repository Method which comprises multiple rules to form a more reliable classifier in rare cases. To illustrate our approach, it was applied to discover important movements in stock prices. From experimental results we showed that our approach can consistently detect rare cases in extreme imbalanced data sets.

    :abstractText: Real time dispatching strategies in a dynamic environment is a growing area of interest. Most of current work focuses mainly on two dynamic aspects of the problem, namely dynamic arrival of jobs and dynamic travel time. The degree of dynamism, for example is defined with respect to dynamic arrival of jobs. This paper focuses on another dynamic aspect, namely the duration of tasks. This aspect becomes important when tasks durations are relatively long and, in addition, one has to respect time windows. We characterize the degree of dynamism of such problems and show that it relates with the expected cost of a static scheduler which is reapplied in light of dynamic events. Furthermore, preliminary experiments indicate that the performance of the scheduler can be improved when the expected duration of a task is overestimated.

    :abstractText: The fast moving and competitive global economy requires that organisations manage their human resources in an efficient and flexible manner in order to tap their full potentials. The management of human resources has crucial role in success or failure of an organisation. Today's services organisations strive to tailor their human re-source management policies that improve their performance by empowering employees. Employee empowerment is a management style that helps organisations to utilise their employee's potential to maximum and be able to react and adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in service provision. This paper explores the possibility of empowering British Telecommunications (BT) field workforce and its potential benefits by using simulator. We investigate the application of a `pull-based strategy' for empowering BT field workforce and its relation with motivation and productivity of BT workforce. Currently jobs are allocated to BT field engineers by a central scheduler; we refer to it as a `push strategy'. In this simulation we attempt to assess the impact of empowerment on BT FE motivation and towards overall increase in productivity.

    :abstractText: Gaussian process model is an effective and efficient method for approximating a continuous function. However, its computational cost increases exponentially with the size of training data set. A very popular way to alleviate this shortcoming is to cluster the whole training data set into a number of small clusters and then a local model is built for each cluster. However, widely used crisp clustering might not be accurate in the boundary areas among different clusters. This paper proposes a fuzzy clustering based method for improving approximation quality. Several clusters with overlaps are firstly obtained by Fuzzy C-Means clustering and then local models are built for these clusters. It has been demonstrated that this method can be used with evolutionary algorithms for dealing expensive optimization problems.

    :abstractText: "In this talk, we tackle a fundamental problem that arises when using sensors to monitor the ecological condition of rivers and lakes, the network of pipes that bring water to our taps, or the activities of an elderly individual when sitting on a chair: Where should we place the sensors in order to make effective and robust predictions? Such sensing problems are typically NP-hard, and in the past, heuristics without theoretical guarantees about the solution quality have often been used. In this talk, we present algorithms which efficiently find provably near-optimal solutions to large, complex sensing problems. Our algorithms are based on the key insight that many important sensing problems exhibit submodularity, an intuitive diminishing returns property: Adding a sensor helps more the fewer sensors we have placed so far. In addition to identifying most informative locations for placing sensors, our algorithms can handle settings, where sensor nodes need to be able to reliably communicate over lossy links, where mobile robots are used for collecting data or where solutions need to be robust against adversaries and sensor failures. We present results applying our algorithms to several real-world sensing tasks, including environmental monitoring using robotic sensors, activity recognition using a built sensing chair, and a sensor placement competition. We conclude with drawing an interesting connection between sensor placement for water monitoring and addressing the challenges of information overload on the web. As examples of this connection, we address the problem of selecting blogs to read in order to learn about the biggest stories discussed on the web, and personalizing content to turn down the noise in the blogosphere."

    :abstractText: We demonstrate that classes of dependencies among beliefs held with uncertainty cannot be represented in rule-based systems in a natural or efficient manner. We trace these limitations to a fundamental difference between certain and uncertain reasoning. In particular, we show that beliefs held with certainty are more modular than uncertain beliefs. We argue that the limitations of the rule-based approach for expressing dependencies are a consequence of forcing nonmodular knowledge into a representation scheme originally designed to represent modular beliefs. Finally, we describe a representation technique that is related, to the rule-based framework yet is not limited in the types of dependencies that it can represent.

    :abstractText: We describe theoretical results and empirical study of context-sensitive restart policies for randomized search procedures. The methods generalize previous results on optimal restart policies by exploiting dynamically updated beliefs about the probability distribution for run time. Rather than assuming complete knowledge or zero knowledge about the run-time distribution, we formulate restart policies that consider real-time observations about properties of instances and the solver's activity. We describe background work on the application of Bayesian methods to build predictive models for run time, introduce an optimal policy for dynamic restarts that considers predictions about run time, and perform a comparative Study of traditional fixed versus dynamic restart policies.

    :abstractText: Popular route planning systems (Windows Live Local, Yahoo! Maps, Google Maps, etc.) generate driving directions using a static library of roads and road attributes. They ignore both the time at which a route is to be traveled and, more generally, the preferences of the drivers they serve. We present a set of methods for including driver preferences and time-variant traffic condition estimates in route planning. These methods have been incorporated into a working prototype named TRIP. Using a large database of GPS traces logged by drivers, TRIP learns time-variant traffic speeds for every road in a widespread metropolitan area. It also leverages a driver's past GPS logs when responding to future route queries to produce routes that are more suited to the driver's individual driving preferences. Using experiments with real driving data, we demonstrate that the routes produced by TRIP are measurably closer to those actually chosen by drivers than are the routes produced by routers that use static heuristics.

    :abstractText: We introduce our work on the backdoor key, a concept that shows promise for characterizing problem hardness in backtracking search algorithms. The general notion of backdoors was recently introduced to explain the source of heavy-tailed behaviors in backtracking algorithms (Williams, Gomes, & Selman 2003a; 2003b). We describe empirical studies that show that the key faction, i.e., the ratio of the key size to the corresponding backdoor size, is a good predictor of problem hardness of ensembles and individual instances within an ensemble for structure domains with large key fraction.

    :abstractText: We present mechanisms, architectures, and an implementation addressing challenges with mobile opportunistic commerce centering on markets and mechanisms that support the procurement of goods and services in mobile settings. Our efforts seek to extend core concepts from research in electronic commerce to interactions between mobile buyers and brick and mortar businesses that have geographically situated retail offices. We focus on efficient mechanisms, infrastructure, and automation that can enable sellers and buyers to take joint advantage of the relationship of the locations of retail offices to the routes of mobile buyers who may have another primary destination. The methods promote automated vigilance about opportunities to buy and sell, and to support negotiations on the joint value to buyers and sellers including buyers' costs of divergence from their original paths to acquire services and commodities. We extend prior work on auction mechanisms to personal procurement settings by analyzing the dynamics of the cost to buyers based on preexisting plans, location, and overall context. We present mechanisms for auctions in single item, combinatorial, and multiattribute settings that take into consideration personal inconvenience costs within time-sensitive dynamic markets and challenges with privacy and fairness.

    :abstractText: ZoneZoom is an input technique that lets users traverse large information spaces on smartphones. Our technique ZoneZoom, segments a given view of an information space into nine sub-segments, each of which is mapped to a key on the number keypad of the smartphone. This segmentation can be hand-crafted by the information space author or dynamically created at run-time. ZoneZoom supports "spring-loaded" view shifting which allows users to easily "glance" at nearby areas and then quickly return to their current view. Our ZoneZoom technique lets users gain an overview and compare information from different parts of a dataset. SmartPhlow is an optimized application for browsing a map of local-area road traffic conditions.

    :abstractText: Our studies have shown that as displays become larger, users leave more windows open for easy multitasking. A larger number of windows, however, may increase the time that users spend arranging and switching between tasks. We present Scalable Fabric, a task management system designed to address problems with the proliferation of open windows on the PC desktop. Scalable Fabric couples window management with a flexible visual representation to provide a focus-plus-context solution to desktop complexity. Users interact with windows in a central focus region of the display in a normal manner, but when a user moves a window into the periphery, it shrinks in size, getting smaller as it nears the edge of the display. The window "minimize" action is redefined to return the window to its preferred location in the periphery, allowing windows to remain visible when not in use. Windows in the periphery may be grouped together into named tasks, and task switching is accomplished with a single mouse click. The spatial arrangement of tasks leverages human spatial memory to make task switching easier. We review the evolution of Scalable Fabric over three design iterations, including discussion of results from two user studies that were performed to compare the experience with Scalable Fabric to that of the Microsoft Windows XP TaskBar.

Thirty people specified what information they are willing to share with whom.. Although people vary in their overall level of comfort in sharing, we identified key classes of recipients and information. Such abstractions highlight the promise of developing expressive controls for sharing and privacy.

    :abstractText: Experience sampling has been employed for decades to collect assessments of subjects' intentions, needs, and affective states. In recent years, investigators have employed automated experience sampling to collect data to build predictive user models. To date, most procedures have relied on random sampling or simple heuristics. We perform a comparative analysis of several automated strategies for guiding experience sampling, spanning a spectrum of sophistication, from a random sampling procedure to increasingly sophisticated active learning. The more sophisticated methods take a decision-theoretic approach, centering on the computation of the expected value of information of a probe, weighing the cost of the short-term disruptiveness of probes with their benefits in enhancing the long-term performance of predictive models. We test the different approaches in a field study, focused on the task of learning predictive models of the cost of interruption.

    :abstractText: We describe results from Web search log studies aimed at elucidating user behaviors associated with queries and destination URLs that appear with different frequencies. We note the diversity of information goals that searchers have and the differing ways that goals are specified. We examine rare and common information goals that are specified using rare or common queries. We identify several significant differences in user behavior depending on the rarity of the query and the destination URL. We find that searchers are more likely to be successful when the frequencies of the query and destination URL are similar. We also establish that the behavioral differences observed for queries and goals of varying rarity persist even after accounting for potential confounding variables, including query length, search engine ranking, session duration, and task difficulty. Finally, using an information-theoretic measure of search difficulty, we show that the benefits obtained by search and navigation actions depend on the frequency of the information goal.

    :abstractText: Interest has been growing in opportunities to build and deploy statistical models that can infer a computer user's current interruptability from computer activity and relevant contextual information. We describe a system that intermittently asks users to assess their perceived interruptability during a training phase and that builds decision-theoretic models with the ability to predict the cost of interrupting the user. The models are used at run-time to compute the expected cost of interruptions, providing a mediator for incoming notifications, based on a consideration of a user's current and recent history of computer activity, meeting status, location, time of day, and whether a conversation is detected.

    :abstractText: We present methods for inferring the cost of interrupting users based on multiple streams of events including information generated by interactions with computing devices, visual and acoustical analyses, and data drawn from online calendars. Following a review of prior work on techniques for deliberating about the cost of interruption associated with notifications, we introduce methods for learning models from data that can be used to compute the expected cost of interruption for a user. We describe the Interruption Workbench, a set of event-capture and modeling tools. Finally, we review experiments that characterize the accuracy of the models for predicting interruption cost and discuss research directions.

We describe the use of the representation in a system that diagnoses states of a user's activity based on real-time streams of evidence from video, acoustic, and computer interactions. We review the representation, present an implementation, and report on experiments with the layered representation in an office-awareness application.

    :abstractText: Intensive computations required for sensing and processing perceptual information can impose significant burdens on personal computer systems. We explore several policies for selective perception in SEER, a multimodal system for recognizing office activity that relies on a layered Hidden Markov Model representation. We review our efforts to employ expected-value-of-information (EVI) computations to limit sensing and analysis in a context-sensitive manner. We discuss an implementation of a one-step myopic EVI analysis and compare the results of using the myopic EVI with a heuristic sensing policy that makes observations at different frequencies. Both policies are then compared to a random perception policy, where sensors are selected at random. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of ideal perceptual actions to preferences encoded in utility models about information value and the cost of sensing.

We present a portion of Protos research focused on the interlacing of reflection and action under scarce resources, and discuss how the techniques have been applied in a high-stakes medical domain. The work centers on endowing a computational agent with the ability to harness incomplete characterizations of problem-solving performance to control the amount of effort applied to a problem or subproblem, before taking action in the world or turning to another problem. We explore the use of the techniques in controlling decision-theoretic inference itself, and pose the approach as a model of rationality under scarce resources.

    :abstractText: We describe the formulation, construction, and evaluation of predictive models of human information seeking from a large dataset of Web search activities. We first introduce an expressive language for describing searching and browsing behavior, and use this language to characterize several prior studies of search behavior. Then, we focus on the construction of predictive models from the data. We review several analyses, including an exploration of the properties of users, queries, and search sessions that are most predictive of future behavior. We also investigate the influence of temporal delay on user actions, and representational tradeoffs with varying the number of steps of user activity considered. Finally, we discuss applications of the predictive models, and focus on the example of performing principled prefetching of content.

    :abstractText: An inescapable bottleneck with learning from large data sets is the high cost of labeling training data. Unsupervised learning methods have promised to lower the cost of tagging by leveraging notions of similarity among data points to assign tags. However, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques often provide poor results due to errors in estimation. We look at methods that guide the allocation of human effort for labeling data so as to get the greatest boosts in discriminatory power with increasing amounts of work. We focus on the application of value of information to Gaussian Process classifiers and explore the effectiveness of the method on the task of classifying voice messages.

    :abstractText: We present S3, a system that implicitly captures the process and products of Web investigations (exploratory searches involving multiple queries). This automatically-created, persistent representation of an investigation enables future review and continuation of suspended search activities. This persistent representation can reduce unnecessary re-execution of queries and enable users to quickly regain the context of a resumed activity. Stored investigations can also be shared with, and augmented by, collaborators. Furthermore, a stored investigation can act as a standing query, proactively updating itself when a user revisits it.

    :abstractText: The intuition that different text classifiers behave in qualitatively different ways has long motivated attempts to build a better metaclassifier via some combination of classifiers. We introduce a probabilistic method for combining classifiers that considers the context-sensitive reliabilities of contributing classifiers. The method harnesses reliability indicators---variables that provide a valuable signal about the performance of classifiers in different situations. We provide background, present procedures for building metaclassifiers that take into consideration both reliability indicators and classifier outputs, and review a set of comparative studies undertaken to evaluate the methodology.

    :abstractText: We formulate and study search algorithms that consider a user's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user's current Web search. Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search. We show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current Web search.

    :abstractText: We investigate the diverse goals that people have when they issue the same query to a search engine, and the ability of current search engines to address such diversity. We quantify the potential value of personalizing search results based on this analysis. Great variance was found in the results that different individuals rated as relevant for the same query -- even when the same information goal was expressed. Our analysis suggests that while search engines do a good job of ranking results to maximize global happiness, they do not do a very good job for specific individuals.

    :abstractText: It is argued that decision analysts and expert-system designers have avoided the intractability of exact computation of the value of information by relying on a myopic assumption that only one additional test will be performed, even when there is an opportunity to make large number of observations. An alternative to the myopic analysis is presented. In particular, an approximate method for computing the value of information of a set of tests, which exploits the statistical properties of large samples, is given. The approximation is linear in the number of tests, in contrast with the exact computation, which is exponential in the number of tests. The approach is not as general as in a complete nonmyopic analysis, in which all possible sequences of observations are considered. In addition, the approximation is limited to specific classes of dependencies among evidence and to binary hypothesis and decision variables. Nonetheless, as demonstrated with a simple application, the approach can offer an improvement over the myopic analysis.

    :abstractText: Although cell phones are extremely useful, they can be annoying and distracting to owners and others nearby. We describe sensing techniques intended to help make mobile phones more polite and less distracting. For example, our phone's ringing quiets as soon as the user responds to an incoming call, and the ring mutes if the user glances at the caller ID and decides not to answer. We also eliminate the need to press a TALK button to answer an incoming call by recognizing if the user picks up the phone and listens to it.

    :abstractText: Studies of search habits reveal that people engage in many search tasks involving collaboration with others, such as travel planning, organizing social events, or working on a homework assignment. However, current Web search tools are designed for a single user, working alone. We introduce SearchTogether, a prototype that enables groups of remote users to synchronously or asynchronously collaborate when searching the Web. We describe an example usage scenario, and discuss the ways SearchTogether facilitates collaboration by supporting awareness, division of labor, and persistence. We then discuss the findings of our evaluation of SearchTogether, analyzing which aspects of its design enabled successful collaboration among study participants.

    :abstractText: Predictive user models often require a phase of effortful supervised training where cases are tagged with labels that represent the status of unobservable variables. We formulate and study principles of lifelong learning where training is ongoing over a prolonged period. In lifelong learning, decisions about extending a case library are made continuously by balancing the cost of acquiring values of hidden states with the long-term benefits of acquiring new labels. We highlight key principles by extending BusyBody, an application that learns to predict the cost of interrupting a user. We transform the prior BusyBody system into a lifelong learner and then review experiments that highlight the promise of the methods.

We present analyses of drivers' destinations based on GPS data recorded from 180 volunteer subjects. We focus on the probability of observing drivers visit previously unobserved destinations given time of day and day of week, and the rate of decline of observing such new destinations with time. For the latter, we discover a statistically significant difference based on gender.

    :abstractText: Despite the connotation of the words "browsing" and "surfing," web usage often follows routine patterns of access. However, few mechanisms exist to assist users with these routine tasks; bookmarks or portal sites must be maintained manually and are insensitive to the user's browsing context. To fill this void, we designed and implemented the montage system. A web montage is an ensemble of links and content fused into a single view. Such a coalesced view can be presented to the user whenever he or she opens the browser or returns to the start page. We pose a number of hypotheses about how users would interact with such a system, and test these hypotheses with a fielded user study. Our findings support some design decisions, such as using browsing context to tailor the montage, raise questions about others, and point the way toward future work.

    :abstractText: We present a principled methodology for filtering news stories by formal measures of information novelty, and show how the techniques can be usedto custom-tailor news feeds based on information that a user has already reviewed. We review methods for analyzing novelty and then describe Newsjunkie, a system that personalizes news for users by identifying the novelty of stories in the context of stories they have already reviewed. Newsjunkie employs novelty-analysis algorithms that represent articles as words and named entities. The algorithms analyze inter-andintra-document dynamics by considering how information evolves over timefrom article to article, as well as within individual articles. We review the results of a user study undertaken to gauge the value of the approachover legacy time-based review of newsfeeds, and also to compare the performance of alternate distance metrics that are used to estimate the dissimilarity between candidate new articles and sets of previously reviewed articles.

    :abstractText: The difficult task of providing access to shared objects is, typically, carried out individually by access authorizers. We motivate and explain here the idea of using distributed collaborative environments to perform this activity. In these environments, the initiative in distributing access rights to shared objects can be taken by information guardians, information consumers, and tools that act as agents of the guardians and consumers. Information consumers are responsible for sending access requests to information guardians; their agents (partially or completely) automate this task for them. Information guardians are responsible for authorizing accesses; their agents automate this task for them. The agents interact with collaborative and communication tools, which must be extended to support the new access-control paradigm.

    :abstractText: Software errors abound in the world of computing. Sophisticated computer programs rank high on the list of the most complex systems ever created by humankind. The complexity of a program or a set of interacting programs makes it extremely difficult to perform offline verification of run-time behavior. Thus, the creation and maintenance of program code is often linked to a process of incremental refinement and ongoing detection and correction of errors. To be sure, the detection and repair of program errors is an inescapable part of the process of software development. However, run-time software errors may be discovered in fielded applications days, months, or even years after the software was last modified&mdash;especially in applications composed of a plethora of separate programs created and updated by different people at different times. In such complex applications, software errors are revealed through the run-time interaction of hundreds of distinct processes competing for limited memory and CPU resources. Software developers and support engineers responsible for correcting software problems face difficult challenges in tracking down the source of run-time errors in complex applications. The information made available to engineers about the nature of a failure often leaves open a wide range of possibilities that must be sifted through carefully in searching for an underlying error.

    :abstractText: We present the use of layered probabilistic representations for modeling human activities, and describe how we use the representation to do sensing, learning, and inference at multiple levels of temporal granularity and abstraction and from heterogeneous data sources. The approach centers on the use of a cascade of Hidden Markov Models named Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) to diagnose states of a user's activity based on real-time streams of evidence from video, audio, and computer (keyboard and mouse) interactions. We couple these LHMMs with an expected utility analysis that considers the cost of misclassification. We describe the representation, present an implementation, and report on experiments with our layered architecture in a real-time office-awareness setting.

    :abstractText: Intensive computations required for sensing and processing perceptual information can impose significant burdens on personal computer systems. We explore the use of value of information to guide sensing and analysis in automated behavior recognition systems, and highlight the role of such computations as a formal foundation for selective attention. We examine several different policies for selective perception in SEER, a multimodal system for recognizing office activity that relies on a layered Hidden Markov Model (LHMM) representation. We review our efforts to employ expected value of information (EVI) computations to limit sensing and analysis in a context-sensitive manner. We discuss an implementation of a one-step myopic EVI analysis and compare the results of using the myopic EVI with a heuristic sensing policy that makes observations at different frequencies. Both policies are then compared to a random perception policy, where sensors are selected at random. Finally, we discuss the sensitivity of ideal perceptual actions to preferences encoded in utility models about information value and the cost of sensing.

    :abstractText: We present research on methods for generating answers to freely posed questions, based upon information drawn from the Web. The methods exploit the typical redundancy of information on the Web by making multiple queries to search engines and then combining the search results into an answer. We focus on the pursuit of techniques for guiding information gathering in support of answering questions via the learning of probabilistic models that predict the value of information drawn from the Web. We first review research on question-answering systems. Then, we present AskMSR, a prototype Web-based question-answering system. We describe the learning of Bayesian-network models that predict the likelihood that answers are correct, based on multiple observations. We review a two-phased Bayesian analysis and present an expected-utility analysis of information-gathering policies using these inferences. After reviewing the results of a set of experiments, we describe research directions.

    :abstractText: The intuition that different text classifiers behave in qualitatively different ways has long motivated attempts to build a better metaclassifier via some combination of classifiers. We introduce a probabilistic method for combining classifiers that considers the context-sensitive reliabilities of contributing classifiers. The method harnesses reliability indicators&mdash;variables that provide signals about the performance of classifiers in different situations. We provide background, present procedures for building metaclassifiers that take into consideration both reliability indicators and classifier outputs, and review a set of comparative studies undertaken to evaluate the methodology.

    :abstractText: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are a standard way to display the performance of a set of binary classifiers for all feasible ratios of the costs associated with false positives and false negatives. For linear classifiers, the set of classifiers is typically obtained by training once, holding constant the estimated slope and then varying the intercept to obtain a parameterized set of classifiers whose performances can be plotted in the ROC plane. We consider the alternative of varying the asymmetry of the cost function used for training. We show that the ROC curve obtained by varying both the intercept and the asymmetry, and hence the slope, always outperforms the ROC curve obtained by varying only the intercept. In addition, we present a path-following algorithm for the support vector machine (SVM) that can compute efficiently the entire ROC curve, and that has the same computational complexity as training a single classifier. Finally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the relationship between the asymmetric cost model assumed when training a classifier and the cost model assumed in applying the classifier. In particular, we show that the mismatch between the step function used for testing and its convex upper bounds, usually used for training, leads to a provable and quantifiable difference around extreme asymmetries.

    :abstractText: It is argued that decision analysts and expert-system designers have avoided the intractability of exact computation of the value of information by relying on a myopic assumption that only one additional test will be performed, even when there is an opportunity to make large number of observations. An alternative to the myopic analysis is presented. In particular, an approximate method for computing the value of information of a set of tests, which exploits the statistical properties of large samples, is given. The approximation is linear in the number of tests, in contrast with the exact computation, which is exponential in the number of tests. The approach is not as general as in a complete nonmyopic analysis, in which all possible sequences of observations are considered. In addition, the approximation is limited to specific classes of dependencies among evidence and to binary hypothesis and decision variables. Nonetheless, as demonstrated with a simple application, the approach can offer an improvement over the myopic analysis.

    :abstractText: Building on Buxton's foreground/background model, we discuss the importance of explicitly considering both foreground interaction and background interaction, as well as transitions between foreground and background, in the design and implementation of sensing techniques for sensor-enhanced mobile devices. Our view is that the foreground concerns deliberate user activity where the user is attending to the device, while the background is the realm of inattention or split attention, using naturally occurring user activity as an input that allows the device to infer or anticipate user needs. The five questions for sensing systems of Bellotti et al. [2002] proposed as a framework for this special issue, primarily address the foreground, but neglect critical issues with background sensing. To support our perspective, we discuss a variety of foreground and background sensing techniques that we have implemented for sensor-enhanced mobile devices, such as powering on the device when the user picks it up, sensing when the user is holding the device to his ear, automatically switching between portrait and landscape display orientations depending on how the user is holding the device, and scrolling the display using tilt. We also contribute system architecture issues, such as using the foreground/background model to handle cross-talk between multiple sensor-based interaction techniques, and theoretical perspectives, such as a classification of recognition errors based on explicitly considering transitions between the foreground and background. Based on our experiences, we propose design issues and lessons learned for foreground/background sensing systems.

    :abstractText: We describe a study of the use of decision-theoretic policies for optimally joining human and automated problem-solving efforts. We focus specifically on the challenge of determining when it is best to transfer callers from an automated dialog system to human receptionists. We demonstrate the sensitivities of transfer actions to both the inferred competency of the spoken-dialog models and the current sensed load on human receptionists. The policies draw upon probabilistic models constructed via machine learning from cases that were logged by a call routing service deployed at our organization. We describe the learning of models that predict outcomes and interaction times and show how these models can be used to generate expected-utility policies that identify when it is best to transfer callers to human operators. We explore the behavior of the policies with simulations constructed from real-world call data.

    :abstractText: We review key challenges of developing spoken dialog systems that can engage in interactions with one or multiple participants in relatively unconstrained environments. We outline a set of core competencies for open-world dialog, and describe three prototype systems. The systems are built on a common underlying conversational framework which integrates an array of predictive models and component technologies, including speech recognition, head and pose tracking, probabilistic models for scene analysis, multiparty engagement and turn taking, and inferences about user goals and activities. We discuss the current models and showcase their function by means of a sample recorded interaction, and we review results from an observational study of open-world, multiparty dialog in the wild.

    :abstractText: We develop and test computational methods for guiding collaboration that demonstrate how shared plans can be created in real-world settings, where agents can be expected to have diverse and varying goals, preferences, and availabilities. The methods are motivated and evaluated in the realm of ridesharing, using GPS logs of commuting data. We consider challenges with coordination among self-interested people aimed at minimizing the cost of transportation and the impact of travel on the environment. We present planning, optimization, and payment mechanisms that provide fair and efficient solutions to the rideshare collaboration challenge. We evaluate different VCG-based payment schemes in terms of their computational efficiency, budget balance, incentive compatibility, and strategy proofness. We present the behavior and analyses provided by the ABC ridesharing prototype system. The system learns about destinations and preferences from GPS traces and calendars, and considers time, fuel, environmental, and cognitive costs. We review how ABC generates rideshare plans from hundreds of real-life GPS traces collected from a community of commuters and reflect about the promise of employing the ABC methods to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thus reducing CO2 emissions and fuel expenditures.

    :abstractText: We describe a machine learning approach that allows an open-world spoken dialog system to learn to predict engagement intentions in situ, from interaction. The proposed approach does not require any developer supervision, and leverages spatiotemporal and attentional features automatically extracted from a visual analysis of people coming into the proximity of the system to produce models that are attuned to the characteristics of the environment the system is placed in. Experimental results indicate that a system using the proposed approach can learn to recognize engagement intentions at low false positive rates (e.g. 2--4%) up to 3--4 seconds prior to the actual moment of engagement.

The models for managing the engagement process include components for (1) sensing the engagement state, actions and intentions of multiple agents in the scene, (2) making engagement decisions (i.e. whom to engage with, and when) and (3) rendering these decisions in a set of coordinated low-level behaviors in an embodied conversational agent. We review results from a study of interactions "in the wild" with a system that implements such a model.

    :abstractText: Desktop notifications are designed to provide awareness of information while a user is attending to a primary task. Unfortunately the awareness can come with the price of disruption to the focal task. We review results of a field study on the use and perceived value of email notifications in the workplace. We recorded users' interactions with software applications for two weeks and studied how notifications or their forced absence influenced users' quest for awareness of new email arrival, as well as the impact of notifications on their overall task focus. Results showed that users view notifications as a mechanism to provide passive awareness rather than a trigger to switch tasks. Turing off notifications cause some users to self interrupt more to explicitly monitor email arrival, while others appear to be able to better focus on their tasks. Users acknowledge notifications as disruptive, yet opt for them because of their perceived value in providing awareness.

    :abstractText: The World Wide Web provides an abundant source of medical information. This information can assist people who are not healthcare professionals to better understand health and illness, and to provide them with feasible explanations for symptoms. However, the Web has the potential to increase the anxieties of people who have little or no medical training, especially when Web search is employed as a diagnostic procedure. We use the term cyberchondria to refer to the unfounded escalation of concerns about common symptomatology, based on the review of search results and literature on the Web. We performed a large-scale, longitudinal, log-based study of how people search for medical information online, supported by a survey of 515 individuals' health-related search experiences. We focused on the extent to which common, likely innocuous symptoms can escalate into the review of content on serious, rare conditions that are linked to the common symptoms. Our results show that Web search engines have the potential to escalate medical concerns. We show that escalation is associated with the amount and distribution of medical content viewed by users, the presence of escalatory terminology in pages visited, and a user's predisposition to escalate versus to seek more reasonable explanations for ailments. We also demonstrate the persistence of postsession anxiety following escalations and the effect that such anxieties can have on interrupting user's activities across multiple sessions. Our findings underscore the potential costs and challenges of cyberchondria and suggest actionable design implications that hold opportunity for improving the search and navigation experience for people turning to the Web to interpret common symptoms.

    :abstractText: Establishing a grassroots innovation pipeline has come to the fore as strategy for nurturing innovation within large organizations. A key element of such pipelines is the use of an idea management system that enables and encourages community ideation on defined business problems. The value of these systems can be highly sensitive to design choices, as different designs may influence participation. We report the results of a case study examining the use of one particular idea management system and pipeline. We analyzed the content, interaction, and participation from three creativity challenges organized via the pipeline and conducted interviews with users to uncover motivations for participating and perceptions of the outcomes. Additional interviews were conducted with senior managers to learn about the objectives, successes, and unique nature of the pipeline. From the results, we formulate recommendations for improving the design of idea management systems and execution of the pipelines within organizations.

    :abstractText: Interest has been growing within HCI on the use of machine learning and reasoning in applications to classify such hidden states as user intentions, based on observations. HCI researchers with these interests typically have little expertise in machine learning and often employ toolkits as relatively fixed "black boxes" for generating statistical classifiers. However, attempts to tailor the performance of classifiers to specific application requirements may require a more sophisticated understanding and custom-tailoring of methods. We present ManiMatrix, a system that provides controls and visualizations that enable system builders to refine the behavior of classification systems in an intuitive manner. With ManiMatrix, users directly refine parameters of a confusion matrix via an interactive cycle of re-classification and visualization. We present the core methods and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly and effectively modify decision boundaries of classifiers to tai-lor the behavior of classifiers to problems at hand.

We examine the interference of the cognitive load of conversational dialog with driving tasks, with the goal of identifying better and worse times for conversations during driving. We present results from a controlled study involving 18 users using a driving simulator. The driving complexity and conversation type were manipulated in the study, and performance was measured for factors related to both the primary driving task and secondary conversation task. Results showed significant interactions between the primary and secondary tasks, where certain combinations of complexity and conversations were found especially detrimental to driving. We present the studies and analyses and relate the findings to prior work on multiple resource models of cognition. We discuss how the results can frame thinking about policies and technologies aimed at enhancing driving safety.

    :abstractText: "Current Web search tools do a good job of retrieving documents that satisfy the most common intentions associated with a query, but do not do a very good job of discerning different individuals' unique search goals. We explore the variation in what different people consider relevant to the same query by mining three data sources: (1) explicit relevance judgments, (2) clicks on search results (a behavior-based implicit measure of relevance), and (3) the similarity of desktop content to search results (a content-based implicit measure of relevance). We find that people's explicit judgments for the same queries differ greatly. As a result, there is a large gap between how well search engines could perform if they were to tailor results to the individual, and how well they currently perform by returning results designed to satisfy everyone. We call this gap the potential for personalization. The two implicit indicators we studied provide complementary value for approximating this variation in result relevance among people. We discuss several uses of our findings, including a personalized search system that takes advantage of the implicit measures by ranking personally relevant results more highly and improving click-through rates."

    :abstractText: "When information is known only to friends in a social network, traditional crowdsourcing mechanisms struggle to motivate a large enough user population and to ensure accuracy of the collected information. We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends."

    :abstractText: Graphical representations have played a central role in decision analysis. Although decision trees remain popular, more general graphical languages can be used to encode relationships among variables of a decision basis. Influence diagrams, introduced in the late 1970s, provide a general graphical representation for decision analysis. We publish, in this first of two volumes of a special issue of Decision Analysis, the original manuscript on influence diagrams, along with a retrospective by the authors. We also include two new articles focusing respectively on the use of graphical models for group coordination challenges and on handling the unintended side effects of interventions.

    :abstractText: "We present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for the max variant of the k-armed bandit problem. Given a set of k slot machines, each yielding payoff from a fixed (but unknown) distribution, we wish to allocate trials to the machines so as to maximize the expected maximum payoff received over a series of n trials. Subject to certain distributional assumptions, we show that O(k ln(k/\xCE\xB4) ln(n)2/\xCE\xB52) trials are sufficient to identify, with probability at least 1 - \xCE\xB4, a machine whose expected maximum payoff is within \xCE\xB5 of optimal. This result leads to a strategy for solving the problem that is asymptotically optimal in the following sense: the gap between the expected maximum payoff obtained by using our strategy for n trials and that obtained by pulling the single best arm for all n trials approaches zero as n \xE2\x86\x92 \xE2\x88\x9E."

    :abstractText: We present black-box techniques for learning how to interleave the execution of multiple heuristics in order to improve average-case performance. In our model, a user is given a set of heuristics whose only observable behavior is their running time. Each heuristic can compute a solution to any problem instance, but its running time varies across instances. The user solves each instance by interleaving runs of the heuristics according to a task-switching schedule. We present (i) exact and approximation algorithms for computing an optimal task-switching schedule offline, (ii) sample complexity bounds for learning a task-switching schedule from training data, and (iii) a no-regret strategy for selecting task-switching schedules online. We demonstrate the power of our results using data from recent solver competitions. We outline how to extend our results to the case in which the heuristics are randomized, and the user may periodically restart each heuristic with a fresh random seed.

    :abstractText: The mean running time of a Las Vegas algorithm can often be dramatically reduced by periodically restarting it with a fresh random seed. The optimal restart schedule depends on the Las Vegas algorithm's run length distribution, which in general is not known in advance and may differ across problem instances. We consider the problem of selecting a single restart schedule to use in solving each instance in a set of instances. We present offline algorithms for computing an (approximately) optimal restart schedule given knowledge of each instance's run length distribution, generalization bounds for learning a restart schedule from training data, and online algorithms for selecting a restart schedule adaptively as new problem instances are encountered.

    :abstractText: Most real-world controllers are composed of proportional, integrative, and derivative signalprocessing blocks. The so-called PID controller was invented and patented by Callender and Stevenson in 1939. In 1942, Ziegler and Nichols developed mathematical rules for automatically selecting the parameter values for PID controllers. In their influential 1995 book, Astrom and Hagglund developed a world-beating PID controller that outperforms the 1942 Ziegler-Nichols rules on an industrially representative set of plants. In this paper, we approached the problem of automatic synthesis of a controller using genetic programmingwithout requiring in advance that the topology of the plant be the conventional PID topology. We present a genetically evolved controller that outperforms the automatic tuning rules developed by Astrom and Hagglund in 1995 for the industrially representative set of plants specified by Astrom and Hagglund.

    :abstractText: This paper discusses the underlying pressures responsible for code growth in genetic programming, and shows how an understanding of these pressures can be used to use to eliminate code growth while simultaneously improving performance. We begin with a discussion of two distinct components of code growth and the extent to which each component is relevant in practice. We then define the concept of resilience in GP trees, and show that the buildup of resilience is essential for code growth. We present simple modifications to the selection procedures used by GP that eliminate bloat without hurting performance. Finally, we show that eliminating bloat can improve the performance of genetic programming by a factor that increases as the problem is scaled in difficulty.

We show that a NFL result does not apply to a set of functions when the description length of the functions is sufficiently bounded. We consider sets of functions with non-uniform associated probability distributions, and show that a NFL result does not hold if the probabilities are assigned according either to description length or to a Solomonoff-Levin distribution. We close with a discussion of the conditions under which NFL can apply to sets containing an infinite number of functions.

    :abstractText: Some designs are sufficiently creative that they are considered to be inventions. The invention process is typically characterized by a singular moment when the prevailing thinking concerning a long-standing problem is, in a &ldquo;flash of genius,&rdquo; overthrown and replaced by a new approach that could not have been logically deduced from what was previously known. This paper discusses such logical discontinuities using an example based on the history of one of the most important inventions of the 20th century in electrical engineering, namely, the invention of negative feedback by AT&T's Harold S. Black. This 1927 invention overthrew the then prevailing idiom of positive feedback championed by Westinghouse's Edwin Howard Armstrong. The paper then shows how this historically important discovery can be readily replicated by an automated design and invention technique patterned after the evolutionary process in nature, namely, genetic programming. Genetic programming employs Darwinian natural selection along with analogs of recombination (crossover), mutation, gene duplication, gene deletion, and mechanisms of developmental biology to breed an ever improving population of structures. Genetic programming rediscovers negative feedback by conducting an evolutionary search for a structure that satisfies Black's stated high-level goal (i.e., reduction of distortion in amplifiers). Like evolution in nature, genetic programming conducts its search probabilistically without resort to logic using a process that is replete with logical discontinuities. The paper then shows that genetic programming can routinely produce many additional inventive and creative results. In this regard, the paper discusses the automated rediscovery of numerous 20th-century patented inventions involving analog electrical circuits and controllers, the Sallen&ndash;Key filter, and six 21st-century patented inventions.

    :abstractText: The automated problem-solving technique of genetic programming has generated at least 36 human-competitive results (21 involving previously patented inventions). Because patents represent current research and development efforts of the engineering and scientific communities, this article focuses on six cases where genetic programming automatically duplicated the functionality of inventions patented after 1 January 2000. It also covers two automatically synthesized controllers for which the authors have applied for a patent and includes examples of an automatically synthesized antenna, classifier program, and mathematical algorithm. As computer time becomes ever more inexpensive, researchers will start to routinely use genetic programming to produce useful new designs, generate patentable new inventions, and engineer around existing patents.

    :abstractText: This paper describes the use of genetic programming to perform automated discovery of numerical approximation formulae. We present results involving rediscovery of known approximations for Harmonic numbers, discovery of rational polynomial approximations for functions of one or more variables, and refinement of existing approximations through both approximation of their error function and incorporation of the approximation as a program tree in the initial GP population. Evolved rational polynomial approximations are compared to Pad&eacute; approximations obtained through the Maple symbolic mathematics package. We find that approximations evolved by GP can be superior to Pad&eacute; approximations given certain tradeoffs between approximation cost and accuracy, and that GP is able to evolve approximations in circumstances where the Pad&eacute; approximation technique cannot be applied. We conclude that genetic programming is a powerful and effective approach that complements but does not replace existing techniques from numerical analysis.

    :abstractText: Genetic programming is a systematic method for getting computers to automatically solve problems. Genetic programming starts from a high-level statement of what needs to be done and automatically creates a computer program to solve the problem by means of a simulated evolutionary process. The paper demonstrates that genetic programming (1) now routinely delivers high-return human-competitive machine intelligence; (2) is an automated invention machine; (3) can automatically create a general solution to a problem in the form of a parameterized topology and (4) has delivered a progression of qualitatively more substantial results in synchrony with five approximately order-of-magnitude increases in the expenditure of computer time. These points are illustrated by a group of recent results involving the automatic synthesis of the topology and sizing of analog electrical circuits, the automatic synthesis of placement and routing of circuits, and the automatic synthesis of controllers as well as references to work involving the automatic synthesis of antennas, networks of chemical reactions (metabolic pathways), genetic networks, mathematical algorithms, and protein classifiers.

For the limiting cases N/M \xE2\x86\x92 0 and N/M \xE2\x86\x92 \xE2\x88\x9E we provide analytical results, while for intermediate values of N/M we perform experiments. We prove that as N/M \xE2\x86\x92 0, backbone size approaches 100%, while as N/M \xE2\x86\x92 \xE2\x88\x9E the backbone vanishes. In the process we show that as N/M \xE2\x86\x92 0 (resp. N/M \xE2\x86\x92 \xE2\x88\x9E), simple priority rules almost surely generate an optimal schedule, providing theoretical evidence of an \"easy-hard-easy\" pattern of typical-case instance difficulty in job shop scheduling. We also draw connections between our theoretical results and the \"big valley\" picture of JSP landscapes."

    :abstractText: This article reports on a project in which we browsed patents issued after January 1, 2000 to commercial enterprises or university research institutions for analog electrical circuits. We then employed genetic programming to automatically design (synthesize) entities that duplicated the functionality of five post-2000 issued patents. The automated method works from a high-level statement of the circuit&#x2019;s intended function. The article addresses the question of what is actually delivered by the operation of the artificial problem-solving method in relation to the amount of intelligence that is supplied by the humans employing the method (something we refer to as the yield of an automated method). The article also addresses the question of the routineness of the artificial problem-solving method &#x2013; that is, the amount of effort required to make the transition from problem to problem within a particular domain. The conclusion is that the artificial method routinely delivers high-yield, human-competitive (i.e., previously patented) results.

    :abstractText: "We present a strongly history independent (SHI) hash table that supports search in O(1) worst-case time, and insert and delete in O(1) expected time using O(n) data space. This matches the bounds for dynamic perfect hashing, and improves on the best previous results by Naor and Teague on history independent hashing, which were either weakly history independent, or only supported insertion and search (no delete) each in O(1) expected time. The results can be used to construct many other SHI data structures. We show straightforward constructions for SHI ordered dictionaries: for n keys from {1, . . . , n^k} searches take O(log log n) worst-case time and updates (insertions and deletions) O(log log n) expected time, and for keys in the comparison model searches take O(log n) worst-case time and updates O(log n) expected time. We also describe a SHI data structure for the order-maintenance problem. It supports comparisons in O(1) worst-case time, and updates in O(1) expected time. All structures use O(n) data space."

We provide an O(k) approximation algorithm for SPMP, as well as a O(k) approximation mechanism that is truthful in expectation. This matches up to constants the best approximation ratio known for Maximum k-Set Packing. Along the way, we develop techniques for obtaining sparse subhypergraphs of an input hypergraph that preserves Ep(\xE2\x80\xA2) up to an O(k) factor, where Ep(G) measures the expected weight of a maximum weight set packing in a random subhypergraph of G. We also give a linear programming based approximation for Ep(G). These techniques may be of independent interest."

This generalizes the well known multicut problem, where k = l. We show that the k-multicut problem on trees can be approximated within a factor of 8/3 + &epsilon;, for any fixed &epsilon; > 0, and within O(log2 n log log n) on general graphs, where n is the number of vertices in the graph.For any fixed &epsilon; > 0, we also obtain a polynomial time algorithm for k-multicut on trees which returns a solution of cost at most (2 + &epsilon;) &middot; OPT, that separates at least (1 - &epsilon;) &middot; k pairs, where OPT is the cost of the optimal solution separating k pairs.Our techniques also give a simple 2-approximation algorithm for the multicut problem on trees using total unimodularity, matching the best known algorithm [8]."

    :abstractText: We present new techniques for the construction of uniquely represented data structures in a RAM, and use them to construct efficient uniquely represented data structures for orthogonal range queries, line intersection tests, point location, and 2-D dynamic convex hull. Uniquely represented data structures represent each logical state with a unique machine state. Such data structures are strongly history-independent. This eliminates the possibility of privacy violations caused by the leakage of information about the historical use of the data structure. Uniquely represented data structures may also simplify the debugging of complex parallel computations, by ensuring that two runs of a program that reach the same logical state reach the same physical state, even if various parallel processes executed in different orders during the two runs.

    :abstractText: Research on auctions and other engineered markets is undergoing a renaissance, spurred by the growth of computing power and communication networks, and the new opportunities for social and economic interaction that they enable. Previous research has been applied to good effect, perhaps most famously by search engines to allocate advertising space in keyword auctions. Other case studies of combinatorial auctions being used in practice can be found in the book of Cramton et al. [Cramton et al. 2006]. Despite these success stories, there is much more to do. In this letter, I will give my opinion as to the ultimate determinants of how successful research on engineered markets can be, with implications for where the community can focus attention to maximize its impact. I will use [Golovin 2007] to illustrate initial progress in the direction I have in mind.

    :abstractText: We present the first uniquely represented data structure for an external memory model of computation, a B-tree analogue called a B-treap. Uniquely represented data structures represent each logical state with a unique machine state. Such data structures are strongly history-independent; they reveal no information about the historical sequence of operations that led to the current logical state. For example, a uniquely represented file-system would support the deletion of a file in a way that, in a strong information-theoretic sense, provably removes all evidence that the file ever existed. Like the B-tree, the B-treap has depth $O(\log_{\ensuremath{B}} n)$, uses linear space with high probability, where ${\ensuremath{B}}$ is the block transfer size of the external memory, and supports efficient one-dimensional range queries.

For general directed and undirected graphs we give an O(log D)-approximation algorithm, where D is the sum of demands, and prove matching &Omega;(log D) hardness results assuming P &ne; NP. For undirected trees, we give an exact algorithm and show how this can be combined with a result of R&auml;cke to give a solution that exceeds edge capacities by at most O(log2 n log log n), where n is the number of nodes. For undirected graphs of bounded treewidth we show that the problem is still NP-hard, but we are able to give a PTAS with at most (1 + &epsis;) violation of the capacities for arbitrarily small &epsis;, or a (k+1) approximation with exact capacities, where k is the treewidth."

    :abstractText: The objectives of this paper are twofold. In the first place we discuss some issues related to the formal description of computer systems and how these issues were handled in a specific project, the selection of a standard computer architecture for the Army/Navy Computer Family Architecture (CFA) project. The second purpose is to present a methodology for automatically gathering architectural data which can be used for evaluation and comparison purposes. We will not discuss the rationale behind the selection of specific test programs and the statisical experiment set up to ascertain the influence of the programmers, the test programs, and the machine architecture on the results. These issues and the actual results of the experiment belong in a companion paper. Formal descriptions of three candidate architectures (IBM S/370, Interdata 8/32 and DEC PDP-11) were written in ISP, a computer description language. The ISP descriptions of the three architectures were used to simulate the execution of assembly language test programs. The measurements collected during the program simulations were stored into a data base for post-processing. Automating the data collection process not only eliminated tedious and potentially error prone hand calculations, but also provided the means to gather information about dynamic program behavior, information that would be almost impossible to calculate manually.

    :abstractText: Methodologies are presented for decomposing algorithms on a classical multiprocessor. The class of algorithms considered are those that can be represented as data flow graphs without decision elements. Two passive sonar signal processing modes are used as detailed examples. Decompositions are performed by modeling data memory bandwidth and data memory interference as the primary constraints on execution speed. Algorithms with low interference between data flow graph nodes require only simple models of memory interference to be successfully decomposed. For high interference algorithms the memory interference can be (1) modeled using a linear model of interference, (2) modeled by a queuing network of exponential servers which is solved computationally, or (3) modeled exactly and then simulated. These three techniques give estimates of the aggregate effect of memory interference to be factors of 10.9, 2.11, and 1.82, respectively (the latter being the most accurate).

    :abstractText: "As technology has evolved the primitive components available to a digital system designer have changed dramatically. Twenty-five years ago the designer constructed systems out of circuit level components such as resistors and diodes. Subsequently switching circuit level components, as represented by gates and flip-flops, became available as small scale integration (SSI) components. With the introduction of medium scale integration (MSI) register transfer level components appeared: arithmetic and logic units, registers, shift registers, etc. The advent of large scale integration (LSI) has made memories and even processors primitive components from which systems are designed. Two trends can be observed from this technological evolution: (1) primitive components continue to increase in complexity and (2) the rate of introduction of new components continues to increase."

A graph partitioning-based representation is proposed that allows these problems to be solved concurrently. A custom design automation algorithm based on this representation is then presented. This algorithm, named CP*-2, was benchmarked against two baseline algorithms on a combination of real and synthetic test cases with respect to two figures of merit: hardware cost and run-time. The real test cases are based on commercially developed automotive applications and the benchmark algorithms consist of heuristic and simulated annealing approaches. On average, CP*-2 was found to generate solutions with quality comparable to simulated annealing with up to an order of magnitude improvement in run-time."

    :abstractText: Wearable computers are becoming more common. A recent workshop on wearable computing in Seattle attracted more than 200 attendees. For the most part, however, wearable computers are being treated as small computers with attempts to provide the same range of input and output devices as on a desktop and to utilize the same applications. We believe, however, that wearable computing is a new paradigm introducing new issues. It is not just mobile desktop computing. The purpose of this workshop is to discuss this position and to identify those research issues that are specific to wearable computers. The goal of the workshop is to produce a white paper identifying research issues in wearable computing and we expect this white paper to be seminal in the oncoming era of wearable computing.

    :abstractText: "The MICON system is an integrated collection of programs which automatically synthesizes small computer systems from high level specifications. The system addresses multiple levels of design, from logical through physical, providing a rapid prototyping capability. Two programs form MICON's nucleus: a knowledge-based synthesis tool called M1; and, an automated knowledge acquisition tool named CGEN which is used to teach M1 how to design. Other tools in the MICON system are an integrated database and associated data management tools. The system is fully functional, having been used to generate designs that have been fabricated. This paper describes the architecture and operation of the MICON system."

    :abstractText: Knowledge-based systems are becoming pervasive in the computer-aided design area. For these systems to achieve satisfactory levels of performance large amounts of knowledge are necessary; however, the acquisition of knowledge is a difficult task. Automated knowledge-acquisition tools (AKAT) provide capabilities for quickly building and maintaining knowledge-bases. This paper describes CGEN, a tool which allows hardware designers, unfamiliar with artificial intelligence, to deposit their expertise into a knowledge-base. A set of experiments which tested CGEN's capabilities are presented. The experiments demonstrate hardware designers can produce high quality knowledge-bases using CGEN.

    :abstractText: Design for dependability has long been an important issue for computer systems. While several dependability analysis tools have been produced, no effort has been made to automate the design for dependability. This paper describes ASSURE, an automated design for dependability advisor, which is part of the MICON system for rapid prototyping of small computer systems. A design for dependability methodology and a formal interface between synthesis and dependability analysis are presented. ASSURE's operation includes dependability analysis, evaluation of dependability enhancement techniques using predictive estimation, and selection of a technique. Different kinds of knowledge used in designing for dependability are identified, including an algorithmic approach for dependability analysis and a knowledge-based approach for suggesting dependability enhancement techniques. Examples of designs produced using ASSURE as a dependability advisor are provided and show an order of magnitude dependability improvement.

    :abstractText: The Wearable Computer Project is a testbed integratingresearch on rapid design and prototyping. Based onrepresentative examples from six generations of wearablecomputers, the paper focuses on the differences in rapidprototyping using custom design versus off-the-shelfcomponents. The attributes characterizing these two designstyles are defined and illustrated by experimentalmeasurements. The off-the-shelf approach required ten timesthe overhead, 30% more cost, fifty times the storage resources,20% more effort, five times more power, but 30% less effort toport software than the embedded approach.

    :abstractText: WEAVER, a channel/switchbox knowledge-based routing program, simultaneously considers all the important routing metrics including100 percent routability, minimum routing area, minimum wire length, and the minimum number of vias. It allows prerouted netsand user interaction throughout the entire routing process, while relaxing the unnecessary contraints of assigning differentdirections?constraints imposed by all of the current channel and switchbox routers. A grid-based router using two interconnectionlayers, WEAVER can be easily expanded to route any shape routing area such as T or +. Implemented in OPSS, a production systemlanguage, WEAVER routinely produces routings requiring less area than routers that focus on a single routing metric.

    :abstractText: "Abstract: Before using CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) applications in mission-critical scenarios, it is important to understand the robustness of the Object Request Broker (ORB) being used, which forms the platform for CORBA applications. We have extended the Ballista software testing technique to test the exception-handling robustness of c++ ORB client-side application interfaces, and have tested two major versions of three ORB implementations on two operating systems, yielding robustness failure rates rangingfrom 26% to 42%. To improve ORB robustness, we also propose a probing method to harden object and pseudo-object related data types against exceptional inputs. Using these probes on omniORB 2.8 has proven to be effective in eliminating some cases of robustness failures found during testing. These results suggest that CORBA implementations currently have significant robustness vulnerabilities, but that some important classes of problems can be overcome with better exception-handling approaches."

    :abstractText: "Abstract: Event logs can be used effectively to improve computer system availability. Uses include retrospective and predictive diagnosis; fault management; failure rate estimation; and trend analysis. Unfortunately, much of the research to date has been hampered by the lack of suitable event data, and occasionally by the incorrect interpretation of the available data. This research uses one of the largest sets of data, and the most intensive investigation of the monitoring process conducted to date, to examine event monitoring and analysis. 2.35 million events from 193 VAX/VMS systems covering 335 machine years were used. Examples are presented which show that monitoring deficiencies complicate the analyses, consume additional time, and make incorrect conclusions more likely. For example, incorrect handling of bogus timestamps changes the mean time between groups of events by an order of magnitude. An analysis procedure to identify defects is provided, along with design rules to create better quality logs."

    :abstractText: Event logs provide an effective means of improving system availability. However, the majority of faults produce many errors because faults propagate in the time and error detection domains. Thus, the ability to coalesce related events is critical. The tupling heuristics developed at Carnegie-Mellon University provide one such methodology. These heuristics were applied to a new and larger set of data in order to evaluate the generality of the scheme and to extend the previous work. The extensions included deriving a semantic understanding of why the rules work, expanded statistical analysis, and a comprehensive sensitivity study to determine the effects of changes in the rules. The results prove that tupling is a useful and general methodology. The sensitivity study enabled the identification of refinements to the rules, while the high degree of skew in the tuple variables enables us to propose that the extreme percentiles be used as an alarm threshold for proactive fault management.

    :abstractText: A method has been developed that allows automating a portion of interface testing. A core component of this method is a simple, yet flexible way to specify a formal model of a user interface, named variable finite state machines (VFSM). The model can be converted into an equivalent finite state machine, from which tests can be generated.The method has been applied to the user interface of Navigator II, a wearable computer system employed by aircraft repair personnel. A VFSM model of the interface was constructed, and used to generate 5,968 tests, each composed of an input sequence and its corresponding expected output sequence. The tests were then applied to an instrumented form of the interface, and the results were compared to the expected output. From the data collected, three error sources were detected in the original interface that had escaped months of previous debugging efforts and field usage.

This form of group context can be used by ubiquitous environments to route communications between users, or sense availability of users for interruption. We explored problems of distraction by co-workers in office cubicle farms, applying our method to the design of a cubicle that automatically regulates visual and auditory communications between users.

    :abstractText: This paper focuses on the design and implementation of a Companion Contextual Car Driver interface that proactively assists the driver in managing information and communication. The prototype combines a smart car environment and driver state monitoring, incorporating a wide range of input-output modalities and a display hierarchy. Intelligent agents link information from many contexts, such as location and schedule, and transparently learn from the driver, interacting with the driver only when it is necessary.

The System explores the design space by finding alternative implementations for a user given behavioral specification. The alternative solutions are obtained by transformations on a graph model. These transformations effect trade-offs between the cost of the hardware and the speed of the algorithm. Heuristic routines are used to reduce the design space by exploring only those alternatives whose characteristics approach a user given set of goals.

    :abstractText: This paper describes the architecture of Computer Modules, or CMs. They are large digital modules of about minicomputer complexity that are specifically designed to take advantage of the rapidly advancing semiconductor technology. These modules are intended to be interconnected into systems that implement a wide range of computational structures. The main features of a CM include a small processor as the primary control element and memory distributed among the CMs in the system rather than centralized into memory modules as in current multiprocessors. CMs are interconnected into a network via buses that each have their own virtual address space to facilitate efficient inter-module memory sharing. This paper includes an ISP description of the address translation mechanisms as well as a discussion of several important implementation issues such as the avoidance of deadlocks in CM networks and the width of the inter-CM buses.

We are currently involved in the design and construction of a multi-micro-processor system to experimentally investigate the problems of building and programming systems with a large number of processors. The LSI-11 microcomputer is the basic &ldquo;computer module&rdquo; that provides processing power and primary memory. The interconnection scheme between the computer modules allows the processors to cooperate in a true multiprocessor fashion: they can share and efficiently access all of primary memory. A number of working groups are now investigating the central problems facing the design and successful application of reliable multi-micro-processor systems and these problems will also be discussed."

    :abstractText: A distinguishing feature of modular design from ad hoc design is the establishment of an intermodule protocol to which all modules adhere. The problem of representing and analyzing intermodule protocol for the control portion of register transfer level systems is outlined. An introduction to two existing graph models of computation indicates that existing register transfer level module sets are representable by various "token flow" models. A single model that is capable of representing the token flow models and some of its analytical properties are illustrated by example. Finally, three examples of deadlocks in existing modules sets are presented. These deadlocks were uncovered by the analytic properties of the new model. One example is due to incorrect interconnection of modules at the user level. The other two illustrate incorrect signaling conventions between modules necessitating a redesign of some modules.

    :abstractText: This paper considers the problem of task allocation for embedded, bus-based multicomputers. The problem is shown to be isomorphic to a generalization of vector packing, and heuristic solution techniques are investigated. A total of 256 packing algorithms are considered, using a divide-and-conquer experimentation strategy on a set of sixteen real and synthetic test cases. Performance is compared based on the number of processors, the utilization level of the broadcast bus and run time. This research differs from other approaches in that task allocation is formulated as a multi-dimensional problem, and general purpose solution techniques are developed that can accommodate arbitrary models for the schedulable resources.

We created an eWatch prototype that senses user activities and notifies them when important messages have arrived. An accelerometer and microphone provide inputs to a model of interruptibility. A vibration motor for tactile feedback and two ultra bright LEDs for visual feedback provide user notification through different vibration patterns and colors. eWatch is transparently integrated into the user\xC3\xBDs environment, and communicates via Bluetooth. This new class of integrated systems underscores the need for new forms of regularity, constraints, and design structure. Our results indicate the power of our method to accurately determine a meaningful context model while only requiring data from our eWatch device."

    :abstractText: "Tactile displays are a viable way for people to interact with wearable computers. Human tactile perception is robust. A variety of shrinking tactile stimulator (tactor) technologies are available. Tactile displays are uniquely appropriate for wearable applications because of their close proximity to our 20 square feet of touch receptors: our skin. Tactile displays can solve issues of intrusive computers and multiple demands on user visual and audio attention. They are discreet and seamlessly integrate with most human activity. Tactile displays will neither conflict with nor replace audio and visual display but rather support information on these other displays and fill in the gaps where necessary. This paper presents our work in optimizing the design of a tactile display and discusses some of the issues and opportunities surrounding tactile displays for wearable computers. Additionally, we hope to inspire more work in this area."

    :abstractText: This paper describes non-ideal properties of batteries and how these properties may impact power-performance trade-offs in wearable computing. The first part of the paper details the characteristics of an ideal battery and how these characteristics are used in sizing batteries and estimating discharge times. Typical non-ideal characteristics and the regions of operation where they occur are described. The paper then covers results from a first-principles, variable-load battery model, showing likely areas for exploiting battery behavior in mobile computing. The major result is that when battery behavior is non-ideal, lowering the average power or the energy per operation may not increase the amount of computation that can be completed in a battery life.

    :abstractText: This paper describes a system developed for determining locations of devices on 802.11 wireless networks. Data representing 18,000 computers registered on Carnegie Mellon's Wireless Andrew is presented from traces taken in 2003 and 2005. Developers make many assumptions when creating applications for wearable and pervasive computers. The data collected by Locator@CMU provides a clearer understanding of large-scale wireless networks and their usage for implementing services and programs. Among the findings, we examine the mobility of a user as defined by percentage of time spent at their home site and favorite sites. Our results show that only a small number of wireless users exhibit high mobility and our data suggests that typical mobile users utilize the network only in a handful of sites. These basic patterns have remained steady over the past two years.

    :abstractText: Carnegie Mellon's Wearable Computers Laboratory has built four generations of real - time speech translation wearable computers, culminating in the Speech Translator Smart Module. Smart Modules are a family of interoperable modules supporting real-time speech recognition, language translation, and speech synthesis. In this paper, we examine the effect of various design factors on performance with emphasis on modularity and scalability. A system-level approach to power / performance optimization is described that improved the metric of (performance / (weight * volume * power)) by over a factor of 300 through the four generations.

    :abstractText: When designing and using a wearable system, it is important to find the appropriate trade-off between system performance and battery life. Methods currently used for evaluating battery life over a range of CPU clock frequencies are often inaccurate because they fail to account for the fact that overall system performance usually does not scale proportionally to CPU clock frequency. We present a modified method that works in all cases, and characterize the battery life of the test system over a range of frequencies.

Carnegie Mellon University has developed an Interdisciplinary Concurrent Design Methodology (ICDM) that takes teams of electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, computer scientists, industrial designers, and human computer interaction students that work with an end-user to generate a complete prototype system during a four-month long course. The methodology is web-based and defines intermediary design products that document the evolution of the design. These products are posted on the web so that even remote designers and end-users can participate in the design activities. We present a comparison of wearable computers and show that their capabilities have increased significantly. Important aspects include the types of data representation and the degree of collaborati! on.

A vibration motor for tactile feedback and two ultra bright LEDs for visual feedback provide user notification through different vibration patterns and colors. User studies identified appropriate notification schemes for mobile and office settings.

The methodology is web-supported and defines intermediary design products that document the evolution of the design.

The design methodology proceeds through three phases: conceptual design, detailed design, and implementation. End-users critique the design at each phase. In addition, simulated and real application tasks provide further focus for design evaluation. The methodology has been used by the class, in designing over a dozen wearable computers, with diverse applications ranging from inspection and maintenance of heavy transportation vehicles to augmented reality in manufacturing and plant operations. The methodology includes monitoring and evaluation of the design process. This methodology is illustrated through a description of developing pervasive computing applications in collaboration with IBM during the Spring 2000 course."

    :abstractText: We present a QoS management framework that enables us to quantitatively measure QoS, and to analytically plan and allocate resources. In this model, end users' quality preferences are considered when system resources are apportioned across multiple applications such that the net utility that accrues to the end-users is maximized. In \cite{RLLS97:2}\cite{RLLS98}, we primarily worked with continuous QoS dimensions, and assumed that the utility gained by improvements along a QoS dimension were always representable by concave functions. In this paper, we relax both assumptions. One, we support discrete QoS operating points. Two, we make no assumptions about the concavity of the utility functions. Using these as the basis, we tackle the problem of maximizing system utility by allocating a single finite resource to satisfy the QoS requirements of multiple applications along multiple QoS dimensions. We present two near-optimal algorithms to solve this problem. The first yields an allocation within a known bounded distance from the optimal solution, and the second yields an allocation whose distance from the optimal solution can be explicitly controlled by the QoS manager. We compare the run-times of these near-optimal algorithms and their solution quality relative to the optimal allocation, which in turn is computed using dynamic programming. These detailed evaluations provide practical insight into which of these algorithms can be used online in real-time systems.

    :abstractText: The problem of maximizing system utility by allocating a single finite resource to satisfy discrete Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of multiple applications along multiple QoS dimensions was studied in [6]. In this paper, we consider the more complex problem of apportioning multiple finite resources to satisfy the QoS needs of multiple applications along multiple QoS dimensions. In other words, each application, such as video-conferencing, needs multiple resources to satisfy its QoS requirements. We evaluate and compare three strategies to solve this provably NP-hard problem. We show that dynamic programming and mixed integer programming compute optimal solutions to this problem but exhibit very long running times. We then adapt the mixed integer programming problem to yield near-optimal results with smaller running times. Finally, we present an approximation algorithm based on a local search technique that is less than 5\% away from the optimal solution but which is more than two orders of magnitude faster. Perhaps more significantly, the local search technique turns out to be very scalable and robust as the number of resources required by each application increases.

    :abstractText: Quality of service (QoS) has been receiving wide attention in many research communities including networking, multimedia systems, real-time systems and distributed systems. In large distributed systems such as those used in defense systems, on-demand service and inter-networked systems, applications contending for system resources must satisfy timing, reliability and security constraints as well as application-specific quality requirements. Allocating sufficient resources to different applications in order to satisfy various requirements is a fundamental problem in these situations. A basic yet flexible model for performance-driven resource allocations can therefore be useful in making appropriate tradeoffs. We present an analytical model for QoS management in systems which must satisfy application needs along multiple dimensions such as timeliness, reliable delivery schemes, cryptographic security and data quality. We refer to this model as Q-RAM (QoS-based Resource Allocation Model). The model assumes a system with multiple concurrent applications, each of which can operate at different levels of quality based on the system resources available to it. The goal of the model is to be able to allocate resources to the various applications such that the overall system utility is maximized under the constraint that each application can meet its minimum needs. We identify resource profiles of applications which allow such decisions to be made efficiently and in real-time. We also identify application utility functions along different dimensions which are composable to form unique application requirement profiles. We use a video-conferencing system to illustrate the model.

    :abstractText: In an Ethernet network, a common type of failure is the temporary of extended loss of bandwidth, or soft failure as it is referred to in the literature. Though the causes of soft failures vary, to the network user such failures are perceived as noticeably degraded or anomalous performance.This work uses anomaly detection as a means to signal performance degradations that are indicative of network soft failures. Detection is done via a signature matching mechanism, call a fault feature vector, which will detect the occurrence of a fault by looking for anomaly conditions particular to the fault. In a two-year study of the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Science Network the fault feature vector mechanism proved effective in detecting faults and discriminating between faults types. This mechanism was also effective at abstracting large amounts of network data to only those events which warranted operator attention; in this two-year study, over 32 million monitored data points were reduced to under a two hundred event matchings.

    :abstractText: When creating mission-critical distributed systems using off-the-shelf components, it is important to assess the dependability of not only the hardware, but the software as well. This paper proposes a way to test operating system dependability. The concept of response regions is presented as a way to visualize erroneous system behavior and gain insight into failure mechanisms. A 5-point "CRASH" scale is defined for grading the severity of robustness vulnerabilities encountered. Test results from five operating systems are analyzed for robustness vulnerabilities, and exhibit a range of dependability. Robustness benchmarking comparisons of this type may provide important information to both users and designers of off-the-shelf software for dependable systems.

Each architecture\xC2\xBFs performance space is mapped and trade-offs are discussed. Steady-state and temporary transient overload conditions are simulated. Simulation indicates that the hybrid architecture\xC2\xBFs steady-state performance is better than the rigid architecture and within three percent of the flexible architecture in the likely operating region. While the flexible architecture always drops order messages during transient overload, the hybrid architecture only begins dropping orders when they compose more than six percent of the messages. In addition, when order messages are dropped, the hybrid architecture drops fewer than the flexible architecture."

    :abstractText: "A taxonomy of fault tolerance in commercial computers is set forth. It is organized around three orthogonal axes: the sources of errors the computer tolerates, the computer's approach to tolerating errors, and the computer's structure. Each of these is briefly discussed. An example of each class in the taxonomy is presented, as well as its approach to answering the following questions: (1) Is the system to be highly reliable or highly available? (2) Do all outputs have to be correct, or only data committed to long-term storage? (3) How familiar must the user be with the architecture and software redundancy? (4) Is the system dedicated so that attributes of the application can be used to simplify fault tolerance techniques? (5) Is the system constrained to use existing components? (6) Even if the design is new, what cost and/or performance penalty does it impose on the user who does not require fault tolerance? (7) Is the system stand-alone, or can other processors be called upon to assist in times of failure? The computers covered are the VAX 8600 and IBM 3090 uniprocessors, the Tandem, Stratus, and VAXft 3000 multicomputers, and the Teradata and Sequoia multiprocessors."

    :abstractText: The results of several experiments conducted using the fault-injection-based automated testing (FIAT) system are presented. FIAT is capable of emulating a variety of distributed system architectures, and it provides the capabilities to monitor system behavior and inject faults for the purpose of experimental characterization and validation of a system's dependability. The experiments consists of exhaustively injecting three separate fault types into various locations, encompassing both the code and data portions of memory images, of two distinct applications executed with several different data values and sizes. Fault types are variations of memory bit faults. The results show that there are a limited number of system-level fault manifestations. These manifestations follow a normal distribution for each fault type. Error detection latencies are found to be normally distributed. The methodology can be used to predict the system-level fault responses during the system design stage.

    :abstractText: In this paper a new modeling methodology to characterize failure processes in digital computers due to hardware transients is presented. The basic assumption made is that system sensitivity to hardware transient errors is a function of critical resources usage. The failure rate of a given resource is approximated by a deterministic function of time, depending on the average workload of that resource, plus a Gaussian process. The probability density function of the time to failure obtained under this assumption has a decreasing hazard function, explaining why decreasing hazard function densities such as the Weibull fit experimental data so well. Data on transient errors obtained from several systems are analyzed. Statistical tests confirm the good fit between decreasing hazard distributions and actual data. Finally, models of common fault-tolerant redundant structures are developed using decreasing hazard function distributions. The analysis indicates significant differences between reliability predictions based on the exponential distribution and those based on decreasing hazard function distributions. Reliability differences of 0.2 and factors greater than 2 in Mission Time Improvement are seen in model results. System designers should be aware of these differences.

    :abstractText: Various switch designs for the hybrid redundancy scheme are studied. A reliability model for the switch is developed and the switch is shown to be a significant factor in the overall system reliability. A hybrid redundancy scheme with a triple-modular redundant (TMR) core may have a maximum attainable reliability for only a spare or two. Adding spares complicates the switch enough to cause the system reliability to actually decrease. There exist conditions under which the switch becomes so complex that simple TMR would yield a better solution. Models for fault-tolerant switch designs are also obtained. Finally, various designs are compared via their reliability models.

The task of computing the reliability function for arbitrary Processor-Memory-Switch (PMS) interconnection structures, however, is tedious and prone to human error. Existing reliability computation programs make one of two assumptions: \xC2\x95 That the case analysis of success states of the system has been carried out. Such analysis must be done manually. In this instance, input to the program is usually in the form of an intermediate representation (e.g., fault tree, reliability graph). \xC2\x95 That the interconnection structure is a member of, or can be partitioned into, some limited class of structures for which a parametric family of equations exists (e.g., N-modular redundant systems, hybrid redundant systems)."

    :abstractText: This paper describes nonideal properties of batteries and how these properties may impact power-performance trade offs in wearable computing. The first part of the paper details the characteristics of an ideal battery and how these characteristics are used in sizing batteries and estimating discharge times. Typical nonideal characteristics and the regions of operation where they occur are described. The paper then presents results from a first-principles, variable-load battery model, showing likely areas for exploiting battery behavior in mobile computing. The major result is that, when battery behavior is nonideal, lowering the average power or the energy per operation may not increase the amount of computation that can be completed in a battery life.

The primary objective of such an environment is to assist the user in the process of experimentation. The emphasis in an IIE is on experiment management (including stimulus generation, monitoring, data collection and analysis), rather than on techniques for program development as in conventional programming environments. We believe the functionality of the two environments should eventually be provided in one comprehensive environment.

    :abstractText: The classical reliability model for N-modular redundancy (NMR) assumes the network to be failed when a majority of modules which drive the same voter fail. It has long been known that this model is pessimistic since there are instances, termed compensating module failures, where a majority of the modules fail but the network is nonfailed. A different module reliability model based on lead reliability is proposed which has the classical NMR reliability model as a special case. Recent results from the area of test generation are employed to simplify the module reliability calculation under the lead reliability model. First a fault equivalent technique, based on functional equivalence of faults, is developed to determine the effect of compensating module failures on system reliability. This technique can increase the predicted mission time (the time the system is to operate at or above a given reliability) by at least 40 percent over the classical model prediction for simple networks. Since the fault equivalent technique is too complex for modeling of large circuits a second, computational simpler technique, based on fault dominance, is derived. It is then shown to yield results comparable to the fault equivalent technique. A more complex example circuit analyzed by the fault dominance model shows at least a 75 percent improvement in mission time due to modeling compensating module failures. A commercialy available 31 gate integrated circuit chip is also modeled to demonstrate the applicability of the technique to large circuits.

    :abstractText: This paper describes an experiment statistically designed to gather data on designers' performances in digital design situations. Results of the experiment not only provide data by which to calibrate the results of register transfer level computer aided design algorithms but also the variance to be expected among designers given identical tasks. The experimental techniques described here are applicable to other non-optimal algorithms such as wire routing.

    :abstractText: A model for predicting multiprocessor performance on iterative algorithms is developed. Each iteration consists of some amount of access to global data and some amount of local processing. The iterations may be synchronous or asynchronous, and the processors may or may not incur waiting time, depending on the relationship between the access time and processing time. The effect on performance of the speed of the processor, memory, and the interconnection network is studied. The model also illustrates the significant impact on performance of decomposing an algorithm into parallel processes. The model's predictions are calibrated with experimental measurements.

    :abstractText: Ultra-dependable computing demands verification of fault-tolerant mechanisms in the hardware. The most popular class of verification methodologies, fault-injection, is fraught with a host of limitations. Methods which are rapid enough to be feasible are not based on actual hardware faults. On the other hand, methods which are based on gate-level faults require enormous time resources. This research tries to bridge that gap by developing a new fault-injection methodology for processors based on a register-transfer-language (RTL) fault model. The fault model is developed by abstracting the effects of low-level faults to the RTL level. This process attempts to be independent of implementation details without sacrificing coverage, the proportion of errors generated by gate-level faults that are successfully reproduced by the RTL fault model. A prototype tool, ASPHALT, is described which automates the process of generating the error patterns. The IBM RISC-Oriented Micro-Processor (ROMP) is used as a basis for experimentation. Over 1.5 million transient faults are injected using a gate-level model. Over 97% of these are reproduced with the RTL model at a speedup factor of over 500:1. These results show that the RTL fault model may be used to greatly accelerate fault-injection experiments without sacrificing accuracy.

    :abstractText: "Experimental research in dependability has evolved over the past 30 years accompanied by dramatic changes in the computing industry. To understand the magnitude and nature of this evolution, this paper analyzes industrial trends, namely: 1) shifting error sources, 2) explosive complexity, and 3) global volume. Under each of these trends, the paper explores research technologies that are applicable either to the finished product or artifact, and the processes that are used to produce products. The study gives a framework to not only reflect on the research of the past, but also project the needs of the future."

    :abstractText: "Embedded systems encompass a wide range of applications, technologies, and disciplines, necessitating a broad approach to education. We describe embedded system coursework during the first 4 years of university education (the U.S. undergraduate level). Embedded application curriculum areas include: small and single-microcontroller applications, control systems, distributed embedded control, system-on-chip, networking, embedded PCs, critical systems, robotics, computer peripherals, wireless data systems, signal processing, and command and control. Additional cross-cutting skills that are important to embedded system designers include: security, dependability, energy-aware computing, software/systems engineering, real-time computing, and human--computer interaction. We describe lessons learned from teaching courses in many of these areas, as well as general skills taught and approaches used, including a heavy emphasis on course projects to teach system skills."

    :abstractText: This paper introduces a systematic approach to power awareness in mobile, handheld computers. It describes experimental evaluations of several techniques for improving the energy efficiency of a system, ranging from the network level down to the physical level of the battery. At the network level, a new routing method based upon the power consumed by the network subsystem is shown to improve power consumption by 15&percnt; on average and to reduce latency by 75&percnt; over methods that consider only the transmitted power. At the boundary between the network and the processor levels, the paper presents the problem of local versus remote processing and derives a figure of merit for determining whether a computation should be completed locally or remotely, one that involves the relative performance of the local and remote system, the transmission bandwidth and power consumption, and the network congestion. At the processor level, the main memory bandwidth is shown to have a significant effect on the relationship between performance and CPU frequency, which in turn determines the energy savings of dynamic CPU speed-setting. The results show that accounting for the main memory bandwidth using Amdahl's law permits the performance speed-up and peak power versus the CPU frequency to be estimated to within 5&percnt;. The paper concludes with a technique for mitigating the loss of battery energy capacity with large peak currents, showing an improvement of up to 10&percnt; in battery life, albeit at some cost to the size and weight of the system.

    :abstractText: Inability to identify weaknesses or to quantify advancements in software system robustness frequently hinders the development of robust software systems. Efforts have been made to develop benchmarks of software robustness to address this problem, but they all suffer from significant shortcomings. This paper presents the various features that are desirable in a benchmark of system robustness, and evaluates some existing benchmarks according to these features. A new hierarchically structured approach to building robustness benchmarks, which overcomes many deficiencies of past efforts, is also presented. This approach has been applied to building a hierarchically structured benchmark that tests part of the Unix file and virtual memory systems. The resultant benchmark has successfully been used to identify new response class structures that were not detected in a similar situation by other less organized techniques.

    :abstractText: The paper describes a system level design approach to the wearable computers project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The project is an unique example of a cross-disciplinary effort, drawing students from mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and industrial design. Over the last six and half years that the course has been taught, teams of undergraduate and graduate students have designed and fabricated sixteen new generations of wearable computers, using an evolving artifact-specific, multidisciplinary design methodology. The complexity of their architectures has increased by a factor of over 200, and the complexity of the application has also increased significantly. We introduce a metric to compare wearable computers and show that their performances have increased by several orders of magnitude. A system-level approach to power/performance optimization is going to be a crucial catalyst for making wearable computers an everyday tool for the general public.

    :abstractText: The aim of this work was to investigate arm gestures as an alternative input modality for wrist-worn watches. In particular we implemented a gesture recognition system and questionnaire interface into a watch prototype. We analyzed the wearer's effort and learning performance to use the gesture interface and compared their performance to a classical button-based solution. Moreover we evaluated the system performance to spot wearer gestures and the system responsiveness. Our wearer study showed that the watch achieved a recognition accuracy of more than 90%. Completion times showed a clear decrease from 3 min in the first repetition to 1 min, 49 sec in the last one. Similarly, variance of completion times between wearers decreased during repetitions. Completion time using the button interface was 36 sec. Ratings of physical and concentration effort decreased during the study. Our results confirm that wearer training state is rather reflected in completion time than recognition performance.

Watches are a particularly critical as display size, processingcapabilities, and weight are tightly constraint.This work presents a watch device with an integrated gesture recognitioninterface. We report the resource-optimized implementation of our algorithmicsolution on the watch and demonstrate that the recognition approach isfeasible for such constraint devoices.The system is wearable during everydayactivities and was evaluated with eight users to complete questionnairesthrough intuitive one-hand movements.We developed a procedure to spot and classify input gestures from continuousacceleration data acquired by the watch. The recognition procedure is based onhidden Markov models~(HMM) and was fully implemented on a watch.Thealgorithm achieved an average recall of 79\% at 93\% precision in recognizingthe relevant gestures. The watch implementation of continuous gesture spottingshowed a delay below 3\,ms for feature computation, Viterbi path processing,and final classification at less than 4\,KB memory usage.

    :abstractText: RADAR is a multiagent system with a mixed-initiative user interface designed to help office workers cope with email overload. RADAR agents observe experts to learn models of their strategies and then use the models to assist other people who are working on similar tasks. The agents' assistance helps a person to transition from the normal email-centric workflow to a more efficient task-centric workflow. The Email Classifier learns to identify tasks contained within emails and then inspects new emails for similar tasks. A novel task-management user interface displays the found tasks in a to-do list, which has integrated support for performing the tasks. The Multitask Coordination Assistant learns a model of the order in which experts perform tasks and then suggests a schedule to other people who are working on similar tasks. A novel Progress Bar displays the suggested schedule of incomplete tasks as well as the completed tasks. A large evaluation demonstrated that novice users confronted with an email overload test performed significantly better (a 37% better overall score with a factor of four fewer errors) when assisted by the RADAR agents.

    :abstractText: A laser range-finder-based system for detecting interactions between people in indoor environments is presented. An entropy-based measure is used to recursively segment tracks of individuals into distinct activities. Probability distributions corresponding to co-occurring activities are compared and similar distributions are flagged as representing possible interactions. Experimental results from two environments are described.

    :abstractText: In this paper, we explore haptic editing as a powerful way to enhance haptic realism. Building upon the framework of a previous implicit-based haptic technique, our haptic decoration technique allows the user to first paint directly on 3D models, and then to sense the thickness variation due to the added paint. Meanwhile, material editing permits the user to edit and feel local material properties such as friction and stiffness in a natural way. In addition, we extended the initial haptic model to support some novel features including a magnetic surface attraction that forces the tool tip to stick to the surface of complex models.

    :abstractText: "Based on a distributed architecture for real-time collection and broadcast of haptic information to multiple participants, heterogeneous haptic devices (the PHANToM and the CyberGrasp) were used in an experiment to test the performance accuracy and sense of presence of participants engaged in a task involving mutual touch. In the experiment, the hands of CyberGrasp users were modeled for the computer to which the PHANToM was connected. PHANToM users were requested to touch the virtual hands of CyberGrasp users to transmit randomly ordered letters of the alphabet using a pre-set coding system. Performance accuracy achieved by a small sample of participants was less than optimal in the strict sense: accurate detection of intended location and frequency of touch combined ranged from .27 to .42. However, participants accurately detected the intended location of touch in 92% of the cases. Accuracy may be positively related to pairwise sense of co-presence and negatively related to mean force, force variability, and task completion time."

    :abstractText: Severe energy limitations, and a paucity of computation pose a set of difficult design challenges for sensor networks. Recent progress in two seemingly disparate research areas namely, distributed robotics and low power embedded systems has led to the creation of mobile (or robotic) sensor networks. Autonomous node mobility brings with it its own challenges, but also alleviates some of the traditional problems associated with static sensor networks. We illustrate this by presenting the design of the robomote, a robot platform that functions as a single mobile node in a mobile sensor network. We briefly describe two case studies where the robomote has been used for table top experiments with a mobile sensor network.

    :abstractText: Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a well-established multi-disciplinary research field. The goal of SHM is to develop technologies and techniques to automatically detect, localize, and classify damages in large structures (ships, bridges, aircraft and buildings). The state of the art in SHM relies on collecting response of these structures to ambient phenomena such as wind, passing vehicles or earthquakes at various points in the structure (either via manual inspections or expensive wired data acquisition systems) to be analyzed centrally. In our demonstration we will show a proof of concept working model of an automated distributed damage detection system using a sensor-actuator network.

    :abstractText: Coalescence is the problem of isolated mobile robots independently searching for peers with the goal of forming a single connected network. This paper analyzes coalescence time for a worst-case scenario where the robots do not have any knowledge about the environment or positions of other robots and perform independent, memoryless search. Using the random direction mobility model, we show that coalescence time has an exponential distribution which is a function of the number of robots, speed, communication range, and size of the domain. Further, as the number of robots (N) increases, coalescence time decreases as O(1/&radic;N) and &Omega;(log(N)/N). Simulations validate our analysis and also suggest that the lower bound is tight. This paper is an extension of [1] where we studied a simplified setting with a stationary base station that the robots search for and coalesce to.

    :abstractText: Area coverage is a well-known problem in robotics. Extensive research has been conducted for the single robot coverage problem in the past decades. More recently, the research community has focused its attention on formulations where multiple robots are considered. In this paper, a new formulation of the multi-robot coverage problem is proposed. The novelty of this work is the introduction of a sensor network, which cooperates with the team of robots in order to provide coordination. The sensor network, taking advantage of its distributed nature, is responsible for both the construction of the path and for guiding the robots. The coverage of the environment is achieved by guaranteeing the reachability of the sensor nodes by the robots. Two distributed algorithms for path construction are discussed. The first aims to speed up the construction process exploiting a concurrent approach. The second aims to provide an underlying structure for the paths by building a Hamiltonian path and then partitioning it. A statistical analysis has been performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In particular, three different indexes of quality, namely completeness, fairness, and robustness, have been studied.

    :abstractText: "This paper describes an incremental deployment algorithm for mobile sensor networks. A mobile sensor network is a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. The algorithm described in this paper will deploy such nodes one-at-a-time into an unknown environment, with each node making use of information gathered by previously deployed nodes to determine its deployment location. The algorithm is designed to maximize network &lsquo;coverage&rsquo; while simultaneously ensuring that nodes retain line-of-sight relationships with one another. This latter constraint arises from the need to localize the nodes in an unknown environment: in our previous work on i>team localization (A. Howard, M.J. Matari&cacute;, and G.S. Sukhatme, in i>Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, EPFL, Switzerland, 2002&semi; i>IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 2002) we have shown how nodes can localize themselves by using i>other nodes as landmarks. This paper describes the incremental deployment algorithm and presents the results from an extensive series of simulation experiments. These experiments serve to both validate the algorithm and illuminate its empirical properties."

    :abstractText: This paper addresses the problem of tracking multiple targets using a network of communicating robots and stationary sensors. We introduce a i>Region-based Approach which controls robot deployment at two levels. A i>coarse deployment controller distributes robots across regions using a topological map which maintains urgency estimates for each region, and a i>target-following controller attempts to maximize the number of tracked targets within a region. A behavior-based system is presented implementing the i>Region-Based Approach, which is fully distributed and scalable. We compared the i>Region-based Approach to a &lsquo;naive&rsquo; local-following strategy in three environments with varying degree of occlusion. The experimental results showed that the i>Region-based Approach performs better than the naive strategy when the environment has significant occlusion. Second, we performed experiments (the environment was held constant) in which two techniques for computing urgency estimates were compared. Last, different combinations of mobile sensors and stationary sensors were compared in a given environment.

    :abstractText: Multiple cooperating robots hold the promise of improved performance and increased fault tolerance for large-scale problems such as planetary survey and habitat construction. Multi-robot coordination, however, is a complex problem. We cast this problem in the framework of multi-robot dynamic task allocation under uncertainty. We then describe an empirical study that sought general guidelines for task allocation strategies in multi-robot systems. We identify four distinct task allocation strategies, and demonstrate them in two versions of the multi-robot emergency handling task. We describe an experimental setup to compare results obtained from a simulated grid world to those obtained from physical mobile robot experiments. Data resulting from eight hours of experiments with multiple mobile robots are compared to the trend identified in simulation. The data from the simulations show that there is no single strategy that produces best performance in all cases, and that the best task allocation strategy changes as a function of the noise in the system. This result is significant, and shows the need for further investigation of task allocation strategies and their application to planetary exploration.

    :abstractText: We describe the design, construction and control of a quadruped robot which walks on uneven terrain. A control system which produces a statically stable gait has been implemented; results showing a straight and turning gait are presented. The control of quadruped robots poses interesting challenges due to a small stability margin (when compared to hexapods for example). For this reason most implemented systems for outdoor walking on uneven terrain have been hexapods. The system described here has the added virtue of using very few inexpensive sensors and actuators. One of the aims of this work is to build a reduced complexity (low power, low mass and direct drive) walking robot for statically stable walking. The other aim is to compare the performance of this robot with a wheeled robot roughly the same size and weight. In this paper we report on progress towards the first of these two goals using a traverse across an obstacle field as an example.

    :abstractText: We propose an on-line algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping of dynamic environments. Our algorithm is capable of differentiating static and dynamic parts of the environment and representing them appropriately on the map. Our approach is based on maintaining two occupancy grids. One grid models the static parts of the environment, and the other models the dynamic parts of the environment. The union of the two grid maps provides a complete description of the environment over time. We also maintain a third map containing information about static landmarks detected in the environment. These landmarks provide the robot with localization. Results in simulation and real robots experiments show the efficiency of our approach and also show how the differentiation of dynamic and static entities in the environment and SLAM can be mutually beneficial.

The core challenge for the SDR program was to develop a multi-robot system capable of carrying out a specific mission: to deploy a large number of robots into an unexplored building, map the building interior, detect and track intruders, and transmit all of the above information to a remote operator. To satisfy these requirements, we developed a heterogeneous robot team consisting of approximately 80 robots. We sketch the key technical elements of this team, focusing on the novel aspects, and present selected results from supervised experiments conducted in a 600 m 2 indoor environment."

    :abstractText: "The problem of teleoperating a mobile robot using shared autonomy is addressed: An onboard controller performs close-range obstacle avoidance while the operator uses the manipulandum of a haptic probe to designate the desired speed and rate of turn. Sensors on the robot are used to measure obstacle-range information. A strategy to convert such range information into forces is described, which are reflected to the operator's hand via the haptic probe. This haptic information provides feedback to the operator in addition to imagery from a front-facing camera mounted on the mobile robot. Extensive experiments with a user population both in virtual and in real environments show that this added haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance, as well as presence, in several ways (reduced collisions, increased minimum distance between the robot and obstacles, etc.) without a significant increase in navigation time."

    :abstractText: We address the problem of navigating unmanned vehicles safely through urban canyons in two dimensions using only vision-based techniques. Two commonly used vision-based obstacle avoidance techniques (namely stereo vision and optic flow) are implemented on an aerial and a ground-based robotic platform and evaluated for urban canyon navigation. Optic flow is evaluated for its ability to produce a centering response between obstacles, and stereo vision is evaluated for detecting obstacles to the front. We also evaluate a combination of these two techniques, which allows a vehicle to detect obstacles to the front while remaining centered between obstacles to the side. Through experiments on an unmanned ground vehicle and in simulation, this combination is shown to be beneficial for navigating urban canyons, including T-junctions and 90-deg bends. Experiments on a rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle, which was constrained to two-dimensional flight, demonstrate that stereo vision allowed it to detect an obstacle to the front, and optic flow allowed it to turn away from obstacles to the side. We discuss the theory behind these techniques, our experience in implementing them on the robotic platforms, and their suitability to the urban canyon navigation problem. &copy; 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    :abstractText: Modeling the effects of robot interaction in multi-robot systems, i.e., the group dynamics, is difficult due to the complexity of such interactions. This article formalizes the concept of group dynamics in the framework of scheduling and presents a proof that multi-robot task allocation (MRTA), in systems with significant performance effects from group dynamics, is an NP-complete problem. As a way of dealing with this complexity we have developed vacancy chain scheduling (VCS), a new formal model of MRTA inspired by a resource distribution process commonly found in nature. VCS is also the foundation of a new MRTA algorithm which relies on optimal allocation patterns to emerge from the stigmergic effects of robot interactions. We present experimental evidence of the validity of the VCS model from high-fidelity simulations. The experimental results validate the VCS model by reliably producing the predicted allocation patterns in both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups of robots. The evidence also supports our claim that VCS is a feasible solution for a restricted class of MRTA problems.

    :abstractText: Neighbor-Every-Theta (NET) graphs are such that each node has at least one neighbor in every theta angle sector of its communication range. We show that for &#x03B8; &#x003C; &#x03C0;, NET graphs are guaranteed to have an edge-connectivity of at least floor(2&#x03C0;)/&#x03B8;, even with an irregular communication range. Our main contribution is to show how this family of graphs can achieve tunable topology control based on a single parameter &#x03B8;. Since the required condition is purely local and geometric, it allows for distributed topology control. For a static network scenario, a power control algorithm based on the NET condition is developed for obtaining k-connected topologies and shown to be significantly efficient compared to existing schemes. In controlled deployment of a mobile network, control over positions of nodes can be leveraged for constructing NET graphs with desired levels of network connectivity and sensing coverage. To establish this, we develop a potential fields based distributed controller and present simulation results for a large network of robots. Lastly, we extend NET graphs to 3D and provide an efficient algorithm to check for the NET condition at each node. This algorithm can be used for implementing generic topology control algorithms in 3D.

    :abstractText: This paper addresses the problem of coverage control of a network of mobile sensors. In the current literature, this is commonly formulated as a locational optimization problem under the assumption that sensing performance is independent of the locations of sensors. We extend this work to a more general framework where the sensor model is location-dependent. We propose a distributed control law and coordination algorithm. If the global sensing performance function is known a priori, we prove that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge. To validate this algorithm, we conduct experiments with indoor and outdoor deployments of Cyclops cameras and model its sensing performance. This model is used to simulate deployments on 1D pathways and study the coverage obtained. We also examine the coverage in the case when the global sensing function is not known and is estimated in an online fashion.

    :abstractText: This paper presents the design of a novel robotic system capable of long-term benthic sampling along a transect. The robot is built to traverse back and forth along a mechanical guide-rail at the bottom of a water body. We present results from localization tests with the robot in a laboratory tank and a shallow swimming pool. A pilot deployment was made at a marina to accurately observe the rate and direction of water flow across a section of the marina inlet. Results from the experiment demonstrate the potential of this platform for monitoring various aquatic phenomena of interest.

    :abstractText: We present a method for reconstructing 3D models of tree branch structure from laser range data. Our approach is probabilistic, and uses general knowledge of tree structure to guide an iterative reconstruction process. Our goal is to recover parameters such as branch locations, angles, radii, and lengths, as well as connectivity information between branches. These parameters can then be fed into functional-structural plant models to study the relationships between the structure of a plant, its environment, and its internal biology. In this paper we present an algorithm for finding these parameters, and results on both simulated and real datasets.

    :abstractText: Relative bearing between robots is important in applications like pursuit-evasion [11] and SLAM [7]. This is also true in sensor networks, where the bearing of one sensor node relative to another has been used for localization [5], [18], [20] and topology control [14], [21], [6]. Most systems use dedicated sensors like an IR array or a camera to obtain relative bearing. We study the use of radio signal strength (RSS) in commodity radios for obtaining relative bearing. We show that by using the robot's mobility, commodity radios can be used to obtain coarse relative bearing. This measurement can be used for a suite of applications that do not require very precise bearing measurement. We analyze signal strength variations in simulation and experiment and also show an algorithm that uses this coarse bearing computation in a practical setting.

    :abstractText: We study the collective transport of robots (CTR) problem. A large number of commodity mobile robots are to be moved from one location to another by a single operator. Joysticking each one or carrying them physically is impractical. None of the robots are particularly sophisticated in their ability to plan or reason. Prior work on flocking and formation control has addressed the transport of a robot group that maintains its integrity by explicitly controlling coherence. We show how flocking emerges as a consequence of each robot contending for space near the human operator. A coherent flock can be made to follow a leader in this manner thereby solving the CTR problem. We also present the design of a hand-worn IMU-based gesture interface which allows the human operator to issue simple commands to the group. A preliminary experimental evaluation of the system shows robust CTR with different leader behaviors.

    :abstractText: Software architecture has been shown to provide an appropriate level of granularity for assessing a software system's quality attributes (e.g., performance and dependability). Similarly, previous research has adopted an architecture-centric approach to reasoning about and managing the run-time adaptation of software systems. For mobile and pervasive software systems, which are known to be innately dynamic and unpredictable, the ability to assess a system's quality attributes and manage its dynamic run-time behavior is especially important. In the past, researchers have argued that a software architecture-based approach can be instrumental in facilitating mobile computing. In this paper, we present an integrated architecture-driven framework for modeling, analysis, implementation, deployment, and run-time migration of software systems executing on distributed, mobile, heterogeneous computing platforms. In particular, we describe the framework's support for dealing with the challenges posed by both logical and physical mobility. We also provide an overview of our experience with applying the framework to a family of distributed mobile robotics systems. This experience has verified our envisioned benefits of the approach, and has helped us to identify several avenues of future work.

    :abstractText: Configuration systems ease the development of distributedapplications from centralized components. However,dynamic properties and consistency issues still presentchallenges. In this paper we introduce an approach focusedon distributed information and control systems. A developerdesigns an application architecture using centralizedclient/server components. The run-time system uses thisarchitecture to set up the distributed application and manageits life-cycle. Our framework is capable of describingdynamic applications solely with static architectures, andguarantees the consistency of such applications even in thepresence of dynamic changes and partial termination.

    :abstractText: "The dynamic and heterogeneous nature of distributed systems make the development of distributed applications a difficult task. Various tools, such as middleware systems, component systems, and coordination languages, offer support to the application developer at different levels.There are several coordination systems that integrate such tools into a complete environment to build applications from heterogeneous components. To achieve extensibility they usually have a layered architecture: An application is first mapped to a middle layer and then to a target system. But this approach hides the specific features of a target system from the developer, as they are not represented in the middle layer, and often induces additional run-time overhead.In this paper we introduce the extensible coordination framework ECF that allows developers to build efficient distributed applications which exploit the specific features of the target systems. Support for target systems and application domains are encapsulated by extension modules. Modules can be built on top of other modules to support refined functionality."

    :abstractText: We present a Model Driven Development (MDD) approach to the development of access control policies for distributed systems. The models are expressed as Meta-Object Facility (MOF) models enriched by Unified Modeling Language (UML) profiles. The view-based access control model is used as an example, for which we present a platform independent meta-model and platform specific meta-models for the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). A management application is used to build instance models for the platform independent and platform specific meta-models, respectively. We present in this paper how the platform independent models can be used to generate the platform specific models, and how the meta-models can be used to generate the models for the specific application. Finally, the platform specific models are used to generate the security policy to be deployed in the security infrastructure. We show how consistence requirements can be verified formally by using category-based graph transformations.

    :abstractText: With the advent of high-throughput data recording methods in biology and medicine, the efficient identification of meaningful subspaces within these data sets becomes an increasingly important challenge. Classical dimension reduction techniques such as principal component analysis often do not take the large statistics of the data set into account, and thereby fail if the signal space is for example of low power but meaningful in terms of some other statistics. With 'colored subspace analysis', we propose a method for linear dimension reduction that evaluates the time structure of the multivariate observations. We differentiate the signal subspace from noise by searching for a subspace of nontrivially autocorrelated data; algorithmically we perform this search by joint low-rank approximation. In contrast to blind source separation approaches we however do not require the existence of sources, so the model is applicable to any wide-sense stationary time series without restrictions. Moreover, since the method is based on second-order time structure, it can be efficiently implemented even for large dimensions. We conclude with an application to dimension reduction of functional MRI recordings.

    :abstractText: A common problem in independent component analysis after prewhitening is to optimize some contrast on the orthogonal or unitary group. A popular approach is to optimize the contrast only with respect to a single angle (Givens rotation) and to iterate this procedure. In this paper we discuss the choice of the sequence of rotations for such so-called Jacobi-based techniques, in the context of joint block-diagonalization (JBD). Indeed, extensive simulations with synthetic data, reported in the paper, illustrates the sensitiveness of this choice, as standard cyclic sweeps appear to often lead to non-optimal solutions. While not being able to guarantee convergence to an optimal solution, we propose a new schedule which, from empirical testing, considerably increases the chances to achieve global minimization of the criterion. We also point out the interest of initializing JBD with the output of joint diagonalization (JD), corroborating the idea that JD could in fact perform JBD up to permutations, as conjectured in previous works.

    :abstractText: We give general identifiability conditions on the source matrix in Blind Signal Separation problem. They refine some previously known ones. We develop a subspace clustering algorithm, which is a generalization of the k-plane clustering algorithm, and is suitable for separation of sparse mixtures with bigger sparsity (i.e. when the number of the sensors is bigger at least by 2 than the number of non-zero elements in most of the columns of the source matrix). We demonstrate our algorithm by examples in the square and underdetermined cases. The latter confirms the new identifiability conditions which require less hyperplanes in the data for full recovery of the sources and the mixing matrix.

    :abstractText: We introduce Model-free Toolbox (MFBOX), a Matlab toolbox for analyzing multivariate data sets in an explorative fashion. Its main focus lies on the analysis of functional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data sets with various model-free or data-driven techniques. In this context, it can also be used as plugin for SPM5, a popular tool in regression-based fMRI analysis. The toolbox includes BSS algorithms based on various source models including ICA, spatiotemporal ICA, autodecorrelation and NMF. They can all be easily combined with higher-level analysis methods such as reliability analysis using projective clustering of the components, sliding time window analysis or hierarchical decomposition. As an example, we use MFBOX for the analysis of an fMRI experiment and present short comparisons with the SPM results. The MFBOX is freely available for download at http://mfbox.sf.net.

    :abstractText: Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) is a generalization of ICA. It tries to find a basis in which a given random vector can be decomposed into groups of mutually independent random vectors. Since the first introduction of ISA, various algorithms to solve this problem have been introduced, however a general proof of the uniqueness of ISA decompositions remained an open question. In this contribution we address this question and sketch a proof for the separability of ISA. The key condition for separability is to require the subspaces to be not further decomposable (irreducible). Based on a decomposition into irreducible components, we formulate a general model for ISA without restrictions on the group sizes. The validity of the uniqueness result is illustrated on a toy example. Moreover, an extension of ISA to subspace extraction is introduced and its indeterminacies are discussed.

    :abstractText: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has proven to be a useful tool for the analysis of nonnegative multivariate data. However, it is known not to lead to unique results when applied to nonnegative Blind Source Separation (BSS) problems. In this paper we present first results of an extension to the NMF algorithm which solves the BSS problem when the underlying sources are sufficiently sparse. As the proposed target function is discontinuous and possesses many local minima, we use a genetic algorithm for its minimization. Application to a microarray data set will be considered also.

    :abstractText: Medical image reconstruction from projections is computationally intensive task that demands solutions for reducing the processing delay in clinical diagnosis applications. This paper analyzes reconstruction methods combined with pre- and post-filtering for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) in terms of convergence speed and image quality. The evaluation is performed by means of an image database taken from a concurrent study investigating the use of SPECT as a diagnostic tool for the early onset of Alzheimer-type dementia. Filtered backprojection (FBP) methods combined with frequency sampling 2D pre- and post-filtering provides a good trade-off between image quality and delay. Maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) improves the quality of the reconstructed image but with a considerable increase in processing delay. To overcome this problem the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) method is found to be an effective algorithm for reducing the computational cost with an image quality similar to ML-EM.

In simple processes obeying mass action kinetics, we find the emergence of linear mixture models. More complex situations as well as hidden influences in regulatory systems with sigmoidal input functions however lead to new classes of BSS problems.

    :abstractText: Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) is an extension of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) that aims to linearly transform a random vector such as to render groups of its components mutually independent. A recently proposed fixed-point algorithm is able to locally perform ISA if the sizes of the subspaces are known, however global convergence is a serious problem as the proposed cost function has additional local minima. We introduce an extension to this algorithm, based on the idea that the algorithm converges to a solution, in which subspaces that are members of the global minimum occur with a higher frequency. We show that this overcomes the algorithm's limitations. Moreover, this idea allows a blind approach, where no a priori knowledge of subspace sizes is required.

    :abstractText: "Joint diagonalization for ICA is often performed on the orthogonal group after a pre-whitening step. Here we assume that we only want to extract a few sources after pre-whitening, and hence work on the Stiefel manifold of p-frames in \xC2\xBF n . The resulting method does not only use second-order statistics to estimate the dimension reduction and is therefore denoted as soft dimension reduction. We employ a trust-region method for minimizing the cost function on the Stiefel manifold. Applications to a toy example and functional MRI data show a higher numerical efficiency, especially when p is much smaller than n, and more robust performance in the presence of strong noise than methods based on pre-whitening."

    :abstractText: Recently, we have proposed a blind source separation algorithm to separate dyes in multiply labeled fluorescence microscopy images. Applying the algorithm, we are able to successfully extract the dye distributions from the images. It thereby solves an often challenging problem since the recorded emission spectra of fluorescent dyes are environment and instrument specific. The separation algorithm is based on nonnegative matrix factorization in a Poisson noise model and works well on many samples. In some cases, however, additional cost function terms such as sparseness enhancement are necessary to arrive at a satisfactory decomposition.In this contribution we analyze the algorithm on two very well controlled real data sets. In the first case, known sources are artificially mixed in varying mixing conditions. In the second case, fluorescent beads are used to generate well behaved mixing situations. In both cases we can successfully extract the original sources. We discuss how the separation is influenced by the weight of the additional cost function terms, thereby illustrating that BSS can be be vastly improved by invoking qualitative knowledge about the nature of the sources.

    :abstractText: Independent component analysis (ICA) solves the blind source separation problem by evaluating higher-order statistics, e.g. by estimating fourth-order moments. While estimation errors of the kurtosis can be shown to asymptotically decay with sample size according to a square-root law, they are subject to two further effects for finite samples. Firstly, errors in the estimation of kurtosis increase with the deviation from Gaussianity. Secondly, errors in kurtosis-based ICA algorithms increase when approaching the Gaussian case. These considerations allow us to derive a strict lower bound for the sample size to achieve a given separation quality, which we study analytically for a specific family of distributions and a particular algorithm (fastICA). We further provide results from simulations that support the relevance of the analytical results.

    :abstractText: Blind source separation (BSS) tries to transform a mixed random vector in order to recover the original independent sources. We present a new approach to linear BSS by using either a self-organizing map (SOM) or a neural gas (NG). In comparison to other mixture-space analysis ('geometric') algorithms, these result in a considerable improvement in separation quality, although the computational cost is rather high. One goal of these algorithms is to establish connections between neural networks and BSS that could further be exploited by for example transferring convergence proofs for SOMs to geometric BSS algorithms.

The solution to this underdetermined problem will be presented in a two step approach. With geometric ICA we get an efficient method for the step--matrix-recovery--while the second step--source-recovery-- uses a maximum-likelihood approach.

    :abstractText: In this paper, a geometry-based algorithm for nonlinear blind source separation is presented. The mixture space is decomposed in a set of concentric rings, in which ordinary linear ICA is performed in order to get a set of images of ring points under the original mixing mapping. Putting those together the mixing mapping can be reconstructed. Various applications to two- and three-dimensional artificial and natural data sets are presented.

    :abstractText: "Motivation: Modern machine learning methods based on matrix decomposition techniques, like independent component analysis (ICA) or non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), provide new and efficient analysis tools which are currently explored to analyze gene expression profiles. These exploratory feature extraction techniques yield expression modes (ICA) or metagenes (NMF). These extracted features are considered indicative of underlying regulatory processes. They can as well be applied to the classification of gene expression datasets by grouping samples into different categories for diagnostic purposes or group genes into functional categories for further investigation of related metabolic pathways and regulatory networks. Results: In this study we focus on unsupervised matrix factorization techniques and apply ICA and sparse NMF to microarray datasets. The latter monitor the gene expression levels of human peripheral blood cells during differentiation from monocytes to macrophages. We show that these tools are able to identify relevant signatures in the deduced component matrices and extract informative sets of marker genes from these gene expression profiles. The methods rely on the joint discriminative power of a set of marker genes rather than on single marker genes. With these sets of marker genes, corroborated by leave-one-out or random forest cross-validation, the datasets could easily be classified into related diagnostic categories. The latter correspond to either monocytes versus macrophages or healthy vs Niemann Pick C disease patients. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

    :abstractText: Multidimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of biomolecules dissolved in aqueous solutions are usually contaminated by an intense water artifact. We discuss the application of a generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) method using a matrix pencil to solve the blind source separation (BSS) problem of removing the intense solvent peak and related artifacts. The method explores correlation matrices of the signals and their filtered versions in the frequency domain and implements a two-step algebraic procedure to solve the GEVD. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (2D NOESY) of dissolved proteins is studied. Results are compared to those obtained with the SOBI [Belouchrani et al., IEEE Trans. Signal Process. 45(2) (1997) 434-444] algorithm which jointly diagonalizes several time-delayed correlation matrices and to those of the fastICA [Hyvarinen and Oja, Neural Comput. 9 (1996) 1483-1492] algorithm which exploits higher order statistical dependencies of random variables.

    :abstractText: An important aspect of successfully analyzing data with blind source separation is to know the indeterminacies of the problem, that is how the separating model is related to the original mixing model. If linear independent component analysis (ICA) is used, it is well-known that the mixing matrix can be found in principle, but for more general settings not many results exist. In this work, only considering random variables with bounded densities, we prove identifiability of the postnonlinear mixing model with analytic nonlinearities and calculate its indeterminacies. A simulation confirms these theoretical findings.

    :abstractText: In this paper we present denoising algorithms for enhancing noisy signals based on Local ICA (LICA), Delayed AMUSE (dAMUSE) and Kernel PCA (KPCA). The algorithm LICA relies on applying ICA locally to clusters of signals embedded in a high-dimensional feature space of delayed coordinates. The components resembling the signals can be detected by various criteria like estimators of kurtosis or the variance of autocorrelations depending on the statistical nature of the signal. The algorithm proposed can be applied favorably to the problem of denoising multi-dimensional data. Another projective subspace denoising method using delayed coordinates has been proposed recently with the algorithm dAMUSE. It combines the solution of blind source separation problems with denoising efforts in an elegant way and proofs to be very efficient and fast. Finally, KPCA represents a non-linear projective subspace method that is well suited for denoising also. Besides illustrative applications to toy examples and images, we provide an application of all algorithms considered to the analysis of protein NMR spectra.

Here, we propose an algorithm including such spatiotemporal information into the analysis, and reduce the problem to the joint approximate diagonalization of a set of autocorrelation matrices. We demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm by applying it to fMRI analysis, where previous approaches are outperformed considerably.

    :abstractText: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has proven to be a useful tool for the analysis of nonnegative multivariate data. However, it is known not to lead to unique results when applied to blind source separation (BSS) problems. In this paper we present an extension of NMF capable of solving the BSS problem when the underlying sources are sufficiently sparse. In contrast to most well-established BSS methods, the devised algorithm is capable of solving the BSS problem in cases where the underlying sources are not independent or uncorrelated. As the proposed fitness function is discontinuous and possesses many local minima, we use a genetic algorithm for its minimization. Finally, we apply the devised algorithm to real world microarray data.

    :abstractText: The goal of blind source separation (BSS) lies in recovering the original independent sources of a mixed random vector without knowing the mixing structure. A key ingredient for performing BSS successfully is to know the indeterminacies of the problem--that is, to know how the separating model relates to the original mixing model (separability). For linear BSS, Comon (1994) showed using the Darmois-Skitovitch theorem that the linear mixing matrix can be found except for permutation and scaling In this work, a much simpler, direct proof for linear separability is given The idea is based on the fact that a random vector is independent if and only if the Hessian of its logarithmic density (resp. characteristic function) is diagonal everywhere. This property is then exploited to propose a new algorithm for performing BSS. Furthermore, first ideas of how to generalize separability results based on Hessian diagonalization to more complicated nonlinear models are studied in the setting of postnonlinear BSS.

    :abstractText: Geometric algorithms for linear independent component analysis (ICA) have recently received some attention due to their pictorial description and their relative ease of implementation. The geometric approach to ICA was proposed first by Puntonet and Prieto (1995). We will reconsider geometric ICA in a theoretic framework showing that fixed points of geometric ICA fulfill a geometric convergence condition (GCC), which the mixed images of the unit vectors satisfy too. This leads to a conjecture claiming that in the nongaussian unimodal symmetric case, there is only one stable fixed point, implying the uniqueness of geometric ICA after convergence. Guided by the principles of ordinary geometric ICA, we then present a new approach to linear geometric ICA based on histograms observing a considerable improvement in separation quality of different distributions and a sizable reduction in computational cost, by a factor of 100, compared to the ordinary geometric approach. Furthermore, we explore the accuracy of the algorithm depending on the number of samples and the choice of the mixing matrix, and compare geometric algorithms with classical ICA algorithms, namely, Extended Infomax and FastICA. Finally, we discuss the problem of high-dimensional data sets within the realm of geometrical ICA algorithms.

    :abstractText: "In blind source separation (BSS), two different separation techniques are mainly used: minimal mutual information (MMI), where minimization of the mutual output information yields an independent random vector, and maximum entropy (ME), where the output entropy is maximized. However, it is yet unclear why ME should solve the separation problem, i.e. result in an independent vector. Yang and Amari have given a partial confirmation for ME in the linear case in [18], where they prove that under the assumption of vanishing expectation of the sources ME does not change the solutions of MMI except for scaling and permutation. In this paper, we generalize Yang and Amari's approach to nonlinear BSS problems, where random vectors are mixed by output functions of layered neural networks. We show that certain solution points of MMI are kept fixed by ME if no scaling in all layers is allowed. In general, ME, however, might also change the scaling in the non-output network layers, hence, leaving the MMI solution points. Therefore, we conclude this paper by suggesting that in nonlinear ME algorithms, the norm of all weight matrix rows of each non-output layer should be kept fixed in later epochs during network training."

    :abstractText: The decomposition of surface electromyogram data sets (s-EMG) is studied using blind source separation techniques based on sparseness; namely independent component analysis, sparse nonnegative matrix factorization, and sparse component analysis. When applied to artificial signals we find noticeable differences of algorithm performance depending on the source assumptions. In particular, sparse nonnegative matrix factorization outperforms the other methods with regard to increasing additive noise. However, in the case of real s-EMG signals we show that despite the fundamental differences in the various models, the methods yield rather similar results and can successfully separate the source signal. This can be explained by the fact that the different sparseness assumptions (super-Gaussianity, positivity together with minimal 1-norm and fixed number of zeros, respectively) are all only approximately fulfilled thus apparently forcing the algorithms to reach similar results, but from different initial conditions.

    :abstractText: In this article, we consider high-dimensional data which contains a low-dimensional non-Gaussian structure contaminated with Gaussian noise. Motivated by the joint diagonalization algorithms, we propose a linear dimension reduction procedure called joint low-dimensional approximation (JLA) to identify the non-Gaussian subspace. The method uses matrices whose non-zero eigen spaces coincide with the non-Gaussian subspace. We also prove its global consistency, that is the true mapping to the non-Gaussian subspace is achieved by maximizing the contrast function defined by such matrices. As examples, we will present two implementations of JLA, one with the fourth-order cumulant tensors and the other with Hessian of the characteristic functions. A numerical study demonstrates validity of our method. In particular, the second algorithm works more robustly and efficiently in most cases.

    :abstractText: The authors report on the discovery of statistical regularities, mathematical laws, and universal characteristics underlying multiscale human mobility. Their study is based on the generation of proxy networks for global human travel behavior from pervasive user data collected at the world's largest bill-tracking Web site and trajectories of trackable items known as travel bugs recorded at a geocaching Web site. From this pervasive data, they extract multiscale human traffic networks for the US and European countries that cover distances of a few to a few thousand kilometers. These proxy networks permit reliable estimates of statistical features such as degree, flux, and traffic weight distributions. The authors show that despite cultural and national differences, universal properties exist in a diverse set of traffic networks, allowing important insight into the understanding of traffic-related phenomena such as the geographic spread of emergent infectious diseases and human-mediated bioinvasion.

    :abstractText: The analysis of complex networks is of major interest in various fields of science. In many applications we face the challenge that the exact topology of a network is unknown but we are instead given information about distances within this network. The theoretical approaches to this problem have so far been focusing on the reconstruction of graphs from shortest path distance matrices. Often, however, movements in networks do not follow shortest paths but occur in a random fashion. In these cases an appropriate distance measure can be defined as the mean length of a random walk between two nodes - a quantity known as the mean first hitting time. In this contribution we investigate whether a graph can be reconstructed from its mean first hitting time matrix and put forward an algorithm for solving this problem. A heuristic method to reduce the computational effort is described and analyzed. In the case of trees we can even give an algorithm for reconstructing graphs from incomplete random walk distance matrices.

    :abstractText: "In the last decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been introduced into clinical practice. As a consequence of this advanced noninvasive medical imaging technique, the analysis and visualization of medical image time-series data poses a new challenge to both research and medical application. But often, the model data for a regression or generalized linear model-based analysis are not available. Hence exploratory data-driven techniques, i.e. blind source separation (BSS) methods are very popular in functional nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis since they are neither based on explicit signal models nor on a priori knowledge of the underlying physiological process. The independent component analysis (ICA) represents a main BSS method which searches for stochastically independent signals from the multivariate observations. In this paper, we introduce a new kernel-based nonlinear ICA method and compare it to standard BSS techniques. This kernel nonlinear ICA (kICA) overcomes the restrictions of linearity of the mixing process usually encountered with ICA. Dimension reduction is an important preprocessing step for this nonlinear technique and is performed in a novel way: a genetic algorithm is designed which determines the optimal number of basis vectors for a reduced-order feature space representation as an optimization problem of the condition number of the resulting basis. For the fMRI data, a comparative quantitative evaluation is performed between kICA with different kernels, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and other BSS algorithms. The comparative results are evaluated by task-related activation maps, associated time courses and ROC study. The comparison is performed on fMRI data from experiments with 10 subjects. The external stimulus was a visual pattern presentation in a block design. The most important obtained results in this paper represent that kICA and sparse NMF (sNMF) are able to identify signal components with high correlation to the fMRI stimulus, and kICA with a Gaussian kernel is comparable to standard ICA algorithms and even more, it yields spatially focused results."

    :abstractText: This contribution describes a neural network that self-organizes to recover the underlying original sources from typical sensor signals. No particular information is required about the statistical properties of the sources and the coefficients of the linear transformation, except the fact that the source signals are statistically independent and nonstationary. This is often true for real life applications. We propose an online learning solution using a neural network and use the nonstationarity of the sources to achieve the separation. The learning rule for the network's parameters is derived from the steepest descent minimization of a time-dependent cost function that takes the minimum only when the network outputs are uncorrelated with each other. In this process divide the problem into two learning problems one of which is solved by an anti-Hebbian learning and the other by an Hebbian learning process. We also compare the performance of our algorithm with other solutions to this task.

    :abstractText: Automating existing processes is as paving cow path compared to major business process reengineering. However, this rather radical approach is not suitable for all business fields. It requires the freedom to modify organizational structures and free core business processes from nonvalue adding activities. In sectors like healthcare, there are a variety of legal restrictions and treatment guidelines practitioners have to comply with. Hence, freedom to reorganize the organization and to omit non-value adding activities is heavily compromised. In this paper we present findings from a case study that exemplify restrictions in process reorganization and suggest utilizing more moderate approaches to process management.

    :abstractText: This paper provides a case study from the Business Intelligence Department (BID) of a leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment. BID is a corporate department that provides crucial information for strategic management activities. In order to support these activities, concepts of knowledge management (KM) can be of substantial importance. Using a conceptual framework, we identified the deficits in managing knowledge assets at the BID and developed a prototype of a KM information system. In particular, we address the problem of an explicit specification of document classification schemas. Thus, we developed a methodological framework for modelling multidimensional knowledge spaces.

For instance, senior citizens, citizens without employment, or citizens with low education utilise online services in a distinct way, often to a lesser extent. Within this paper, we examine how such digital divide groups make use of different online services. Here, four types on services are taken into account and contrasted with each other: Internet usage, E-Commerce usage, E-Government for Information and E-Government for Transaction. As a result, we develop the E-Inclusion-Gap Model which addresses gaps between such service-specific usage and we discuss possible reasons behind them."

    :abstractText: "Within the public sector domain there is great potential for business process optimization through ICT. However, until today these possibilities remain largely unexploited. To measure the impact of ICT-investments all processes of a public administration have to be taken into account. The PICTURE modelling method has been proposed as a way to efficiently model the whole process landscape of a public administration. Based on the processes captured, the impact of certain ICT functionalities can be analyzed. ICT investment decisions become more transparent towards the political leadership which are the decision makers in the public sector. This paper has two research objectives: First, an architecture for an semi-automated evaluation of ICT investment decisions is introduced. Second, the practical feasibility of the architecture is shown based on an investment decision for a document management system."

    :abstractText: Being confronted with decreasing margins and a rising customer demand for integrated solutions, manufacturing companies integrate complementary services into their portfolio. Offering product-service packages (consist- ing of products and services) demands for set- ting up integrated product-service systems, which incorporate the coordinated design and provision of products and services. Conceptual Modeling is an established approach to support such efforts. This paper evaluates the current support of reference models and modeling languages for setting up conceptual models in the area of product-service systems. Consecutively, some perspectives are presented to induce further re- search in this field.

    :abstractText: In the move of eGovernment, process analysis and optimization of administrative procedures are key prerequisites for successful organizational and technical re-structuring of municipal administrations. The full exploitation of the potential of information and communications technology can only be achieved through structured procedures. An integrated process view, which gives an overview of organization units, is vital in the context of any attempts at administration modernization. The high degree of complexity of process models, resulting from the multitude of modelling aims, objects, methods and users, requires both systematic preparation, and a methodical approach to the implementation of process-oriented E-Government projects. Therefore this article provides a procedure model for process-oriented organizational engineering, with reference to the example of local government building permission procedures.

    :abstractText: At the present time, several shortcomings prevent the more effective use and more intense application of web information systems. Recent developments that are subsumed by the term Semantic Web aim to solve these problems. The inherent idea behind these approaches is the annotation of data with metadata, in order to enhance automated processing and the use of ontologies to describe data semantically. However, the emergence of the Semantic Web raises new issues (e.g. significantly higher complexity) for web information system engineers. From an information system engineering perspective, conceptual modeling is an approach for dealing with high complexity and diversified project teams. On the one hand, conceptual models facilitate the (semi)automated generation of information systems. On the other, they foster communication between project team members and provide a sound basis for information system development.In this paper, we present an approach to modeling semantic navigation structures. This approach aims at modeling complex, role-based and integrated navigation structures for structured and semi-structured data. Since navigation via links is the only way for users to interact with the web information system and, to a large extent, determines their ability to retrieve the desired information, a proper definition of these navigation structures is essential for a successful web information system. Comprehensible and useful navigation structures can be derived from existing structures and hierarchies in organizations. Thus, an alignment of information systems with the information needs of users, can be achieved. Furthermore, our approach supports emergent technologies for the Semantic Web.

    :abstractText: Change management describes a structured approach to transitions from the present state to a desired state. Reference models can assist this process since they provide a solution schema for specific problems by adapting best or common-practice approaches. The configuration of reference models has been a field of research in the past. However, the integrative configuration of different reference models or respective reference models serving multiple purposes lacks applicable methods. In practice this is a common problem, as the simultaneous implementation and/or maintenance of business processes in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and business intelligence system shows. We propose a methodology that allows the integrated configuration of conceptual models for transaction processing and decision support by integrating meta models for respective modelling languages. Additionally, its application is exemplified by extending an existing reference model in a business case.

In Germany the introduction of New Public Management and double-entry accounting enable public administrations to get the opportunity to use cost-centered accounting mechanisms to establish new governance mechanisms. Process modelling in this case can be a useful instrument to help the public administrations decision- and policy-makers to structure their activities and capture relevant information. In combination with approaches like Activity-Based Costing, higher management level can be supported with a reasonable data base for fruitful and reasonable governance approaches. Therefore, the aim of this article is combining the public sector domain specific process modelling method PICTURE and concept of activity-based costing for supporting Public Administrations in process-based Governance.

    :abstractText: Business Intelligence (BI) is an established instrument to support public administrations in their management tasks by increasing their information level. BI is of special interest in the context of introducing accrual accounting in public administrations as this affects the information level of different stakeholders, leading to a possible decrease for municipal councils. The principal-agent theory can help to explain different behavioral intentions of the stakeholders concerning the introduction of BI. We employ a single qualitative case study to analyze these behavioral intentions. It shows that the introduction of accrual accounting did decrease the information level of the municipal council making the principal-agent problems possible. Furthermore, it shows that BI might be a solution for this problem. Therefore, council members show the behavioral intention to support the BI implementation while administration staff members rather resist it. Based on these finding, we discuss implications for practice and future research.

    :abstractText: Recognizing patterns in conceptual models is useful for a number of purposes, like revealing syntactical errors, model comparison, and identification of business process improvement potentials. In this contribution, we introduce an approach for the specification and matching of structural patterns in conceptual models. Unlike existing approaches, we do not focus on a certain application problem or a specific modeling language. Instead, our approach is generic making it applicable for any pattern matching purpose and any conceptual modeling language. In order to build sets representing structural model patterns, we define operations based on set theory, which can be applied to arbitrary sets of model elements and relationships. Besides a conceptual specification of our approach, we present a prototypical modeling tool that shows its applicability.

    :abstractText: A precondition for the appropriate analysis of conceptual models is not only their syntactic correctness but also their semantic comparability. Assuring comparability is challenging especially when models are developed by different persons. Empirical studies show that such models can vary heavily, especially in model element naming, even if they express the same issue. In contrast to most ontology-driven approaches proposing the resolution of these differences ex-post, we introduce an approach that avoids naming differences in conceptual models already during modeling. Therefore we formalize naming conventions combining domain thesauri and phrase structures based on a lin-guistic grammar. This allows for guiding modelers automatically during the modeling process using standardized labels for model elements. Our approach is generic, making it applicable for any modeling language.

    :abstractText: "Business Process Management is becoming an ever more important aspect for organizations alongside with Business Process Diagrams as a tool to describe business processes. So far process modeling has been mainly performed with generic process modeling languages. These approaches have however limitations when it comes to the needs of specific problem domains or automated process analysis. Semantic building block based languages (SBBL) aim to overcome those limitations by integrating domain semantics in the modeling language. However, this class of languages is only useful if they exhibit the same expressiveness as generic languages. In this paper we strive to answer this question by comparing the expressiveness of the SBBL language PICTURE with ARIS as a generic language based on the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology, showing that PICTURE has hardly construct deficits compared to ARIS while showing less construct redundancy and construct overload in its constructs.

We implemented a wearable computing platform consisting of an array of sensors and application software to motivate users to reach fitness goals and prevent harm in a real-time environment. Evaluation and testing were done on 65 users in four groups: students, health club members, ROTC members and Baby Boomer-age individuals. Comparing the Personal Wellness Coach against an existing exercise product, our results indicate that this system is an effective tool that is less intrusive and in some cases can perform like a personal trainer and help improve user efficiency."

    :abstractText: Metronaut is a novel wearable computer which captures information, senses position, provides wide range communications, consumes less than one watt of power, and weighs less than one pound. Metronaut employs a bar code reader for information input and position location, a two-way pager for communications, and an ARM processor for computation. Metronaut's application is schedule negotiation and guidance instructions for a visitor to the CMU campus. The visitor's position is determined from reading bar codes at information signs around campus. Modifications to the schedule are negotiated using the two-way pager for communications with the campus computing infrastructure. Metronaut is alternatively powered by a mechanical flywheel converting kinetic energy to electrical energy.

    :abstractText: Carnegie Mellon's Wearable Computers project is defining the future for not only computing technologies but also for the use of computers in daily activities. Fifteen generations of CMU's wearable computers are evolutionary steps in the quest for new ways to improve and augment the integration of information in the mobile environment. The complexity of their architectures has increased by a factor of over 200, and the complexity of the applications has also increased significantly. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of their capabilities and evaluate the performance of audio-centric CMU wearable computers.

    :abstractText: "This paper describes the design and evaluation of a technique, Direct Pointer, that enables users to interact intuitively with large displays using cameras equipped on handheld devices, such as mobile phones and personal digital assistant (PDA). In contrast to many existing interaction methods that attempt to address the same problem, ours offers direct manipulation of the pointer position with continuous visual feedback. The primary advantage of this technique is that it only requires equipment that is readily available: an electronic display, a handheld digital camera, and a connection between the two. No special visual markers in the display content are needed, nor are fixed cameras pointing at the display. We evaluated the performance of Direct Pointer as an interaction product, showing that it performs as well as comparable techniques that require more sophisticated equipment."

    :abstractText: In this paper, we present findings and design decisions arisen while designing a review sheet within the confines of a pre-existing digital textbook, AdaptiveBook. Through user studies, we found that instructors and students cited a lack of both context and integration as the major problems in current high-tech teaching and studying tools. Because research on electronic books indicates that metaphors "reduce users' cognitive load when navigating and acquiring information" [1], our design aims to address the lack of context and integration by creating an intuitive review sheet metaphor while leveraging the power of a digital medium.

    :abstractText: Comicboarding is a participatory design method that uses specially created comic books to generate engaging, productive brainstorming sessions with children. By leveraging known plot formats, interaction styles, and characters in comics, researchers can elicit ideas even from children who are not accustomed to brainstorming, such as those from schools were rote learning is the norm. We conducted an experiment using two variants of the comicboarding methodology with 17 children in China, where traditional participatory design may fail in the face of local cultural practices. The results suggest that comicboarding holds promise for co-design with children.

This paper presents user research to understand the discrepancy between parents and their children and attempts to address them with the design of an information appliance. The appliance uses novel techniques to magnify and emphasize unidirectional social presence data so as to comply with cultural social protocol. It attempts to support interaction ranging from peripheral awareness to real-time conversation. Initial reactions to the design are also presented.

    :abstractText: Mischief is a system to support traditional classroom practices between a remote instructor and a group of collocated students. Meant for developing regions, each student in the classroom is given a mouse and these are connected to a single machine and shared display. We present observations of teaching practices in rural Chinese classrooms that led to Mischief's design. Mischief's user interface, with which scores of collocated students can interact simultaneously, supports anonymous responses, communicates focus of attention, and maintains the role of the instructor. Mischief is an extensible platform in which Microsoft PowerPoint slides, used commonly in developing regions, are made interactive. We setup a controlled environment where Mischief was used by classrooms of children with a remote math instructor. The results from the study provided insight into the usability and capacity of the system to support traditional classroom interactions. These observations were also the impetus for a redesign of several components of Mischief and are also presented. These findings contribute both a novel system for synchronous distance education in an affordable manner and design insights for creators of related systems.

    :abstractText: Mischief is a system for classroom interaction that allows multiple children to use individual mice and cursors to interact with a single large display [20]. While the system can support large groups of children, it is unclear how children's performance is affected as group size increases. We explore this question via a study involving two tasks, with children working in group sizes ranging from 1 to 32. The first required reciprocal selection of two on-screen targets, resembling a swarm pointing scenario that might be used in educational applications. The second, a more temporally and spatially distributed pointing task, had children entering different words by selecting characters on an on-screen keyboard. Results indicate that performance is significantly affected by group size only when targets are small. Further, group size had a smaller effect when pointing was spatially and temporally distributed than when everyone was concurrently aiming at the same targets.

    :abstractText: The authors developed a system in which visually dense displays of thumbnail imagery in storyboard views are used for shot-based video retrieval. The views allow for effective retrieval, as evidenced by the success achieved by expert users with the system in interactive query for NIST TRECVID 2002 and 2003. This paper demonstrates that novice users also achieve comparatively high retrieval performance with these views using the TRECVID 2003 benchmarks. Through an analysis of the user interaction logs, heuristic evaluation, and think-aloud protocol, the usability of the video information retrieval system is appraised with respect to shot-based retrieval. Design implications are presented based on these TRECVID usability evaluations regarding efficient, effective information retrieval interfaces to locate visual information from video corpora.

    :abstractText: "This paper investigates two methods of improving the user experience of camera-based interaction. First, problems that arise when avatars are designed to mimic a user's physical actions are presented. Second, a solution is proposed: adding a layer of separation between user and avatar while retaining intuitive user control. Two methods are proposed for this separation: spatially and temporally. Implementations of these methods are then presented in the context of a simple game and evaluate their effect on performance and satisfaction. Results of a human subject experiment are presented, showing that reducing the amount of user control can maintain, and even improve, user satisfaction if the design of such a reduction is appropriate. This is followed by a discussion of how the findings inform camera-based game design."

    :abstractText: This paper investigates the level of metadata accuracy required for image filters to be valuable to users. Access to large digital image and video collections is hampered by ambiguous and incomplete metadata attributed to imagery. Though improvements are constantly made in the automatic derivation of semantic feature concepts such as indoor, outdoor, face, and cityscape, it is unclear how good these improvements should be and under what circumstances they are effective. This paper explores the relationship between metadata accuracy and effectiveness of retrieval using an amateur photo collection, documentary video, and news video. The accuracy of the feature classification is varied from performance typical of automated classifications today to ideal performance taken from manually generated truth data. Results establish an accuracy threshold at which semantic features can be useful, and empirically quantify the collection size when filtering first shows its effectiveness.

    :abstractText: A recent trend in interface design for classrooms in developing regions has many students interacting on the same display using mice. Text entry has emerged as an important problem preventing such mouse-based singledisplay groupware systems from offering compelling interactive activities. We explore the design space of mouse-based text entry and develop 13 techniques with novel characteristics suited to the multiple mouse scenario. We evaluated these in a 3-phase study over 14 days with 40 students in 2 developing region schools. The results show that one technique effectively balanced all of our design dimensions, another was most preferred by students, and both could benefit from augmentation to support collaborative interaction. Our results also provide insights into the factors that create an optimal text entry technique for single-display groupware systems.

    :abstractText: While there are many ways to develop search expertise, I maintain that most members of the general public do so in an inefficient manner. One reason is that, with current tools, is difficult to observe experts as a means of acquiring search expertise in a scalable fashion. This calls for a redesign of computer-mediated communication tools to make individual search strategies visible to other users. I present a research agenda to investigate this claim, which draws upon theories of social learning. I use design-based research to build novel systems that enable imitation-based learning of search expertise.

    :abstractText: We provide a natural learning process in which the joint frequency of (time-averaged) empirical play converges into the set of convex combinations of Nash equilibria. Furthermore, the actual distribution of players' actions is close to some (approximate) Nash equilibria on most rounds (on all but a vanishing fraction of the rounds). In this process, all players rationally choose their actions using a public prediction made by a deterministic, weakly calibrated algorithm. For this to be possible, we show that such a deterministic (weakly) calibrated learning algorithm exists.

The data structure requires O(n) space regardless of the metric's structure yet maintains all performance properties of a navigating net (Krauthgamer & Lee, 2004b). If the point set has a bounded expansion constant c, which is a measure of the intrinsic dimensionality, as defined in (Karger & Ruhl, 2002), the cover tree data structure can be constructed in O (c6n log n) time. Furthermore, nearest neighbor queries require time only logarithmic in n, in particular O (c12 log n) time. Our experimental results show speedups over the brute force search varying between one and several orders of magnitude on natural machine learning datasets.

    :abstractText: We examine correlated equilibria in the recently introduced formalism of graphical games, a succinct representation for multiplayer games. We establish a natural and powerful relationship between the graphical structure of a multiplayer game and a certain Markov network representing distributions over joint actions. Our first main result establishes that this Markov network succinctly represents all correlated equilibria of the graphical game up to expected payoff equivalence. Our second main result provides a general algorithm for computing correlated equilibria in a graphical game based on its associated Markov network. For a special class of graphical games that includes trees, this algorithm runs in time polynomial in the graphical game representation (which is polynomial in the number of players and exponential in the graph degree).

    :abstractText: Anatomical and pharmacological evidence suggests that the dorsal raphe serotonin system and the ventral tegmental and substantia nigra dopamine system may act as mutual opponents. In the light of the temporal difference model of the involvement of the dopamine system in reward learning, we consider three aspects of motivational opponency involving dopamine and serotonin. We suggest that a tonic serotonergic signal reports the long-run average reward rate as part of an average-case reinforcement learning model; that a tonic dopaminergic signal reports the long-run average punishment rate in a similar context; and finally speculate that a phasic serotonin signal might report an ongoing prediction error for future punishment.

    :abstractText: In the temporal difference model of primate dopamine neurons, their phasic activity reports a prediction error for future reward. This model is supported by a wealth of experimental data. However, in certain circumstances, the activity of the dopamine cells seems anomalous under the model, as they respond in particular ways to stimuli that are not obviously related to predictions of reward. In this paper, we address two important sets of anomalies, those having to do with generalization and novelty. Generalization responses are treated as the natural consequence of partial information; novelty responses are treated by the suggestion that dopamine cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including exploration bonuses and shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for dopamine in terms of the mechanistic attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration.

    :abstractText: In the multi-view regression problem, we have a regression problem where the input variable (which is a real vector) can be partitioned into two different views, where it is assumed that either view of the input is sufficient to make accurate predictions -- this is essentially (a significantly weaker version of) the co-training assumption for the regression problem. We provide a semi-supervised algorithm which first uses unlabeled data to learn a norm (or, equivalently, a kernel) and then uses labeled data in a ridge regression algorithm (with this induced norm) to provide the predictor. The unlabeled data is used via canonical correlation analysis (CCA, which is a closely related to PCA for two random variables) to derive an appropriate norm over functions. We are able to characterize the intrinsic dimensionality of the subsequent ridge regression problem (which uses this norm) by the correlation coefficients provided by CCA in a rather simple expression. Interestingly, the norm used by the ridge regression algorithm is derived from CCA, unlike in standard kernel methods where a special apriori norm is assumed (i.e. a Banach space is assumed). We discuss how this result shows that unlabeled data can decrease the sample complexity.

    :abstractText: This paper introduces the Banditron, a variant of the Perceptron [Rosenblatt, 1958], for the multiclass bandit setting. The multiclass bandit setting models a wide range of practical supervised learning applications where the learner only receives partial feedback (referred to as "bandit" feedback, in the spirit of multi-armed bandit models) with respect to the true label (e.g. in many web applications users often only provide positive "click" feedback which does not necessarily fully disclose a true label). The Banditron has the ability to learn in a multiclass classification setting with the "bandit" feedback which only reveals whether or not the prediction made by the algorithm was correct or not (but does not necessarily reveal the true label). We provide (relative) mistake bounds which show how the Banditron enjoys favorable performance, and our experiments demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm. Furthermore, this paper pays close attention to the important special case when the data is linearly separable --- a problem which has been exhaustively studied in the full information setting yet is novel in the bandit setting.

    :abstractText: We consider the most realistic reinforcement learning setting in which an agent starts in an unknown environment (the POMDP) and must follow one continuous and uninterrupted chain of experience with no access to "resets" or "offline" simulation. We provide algorithms for general connected POMDPs that obtain near optimal average reward. One algorithm we present has a convergence rate which depends exponentially on a certain horizon time of an optimal policy, but has no dependence on the number of (unobservable) states. The main building block of our algorithms is an implementation of an approximate reset strategy, which we show always exists in every POMDP. An interesting aspect of our algorithms is how they use this strategy when balancing exploration and exploitation.

    :abstractText: We consider the fundamental problem of monitoring (i.e. tracking) the belief state in a dynamic system, when the model is only approximately correct and when the initial belief state might be unknown. In this general setting where the model is (perhaps only slightly) mis-specified, monitoring (and consequently planning) may be impossible as errors might accumulate over time. We provide a new characterization, the value of observation, which allows us to bound the error accumulation. The value of observation is a parameter that governs how much information the observation provides. For instance, in Partially Observable MDPs when it is 1 the POMDP is an MDP while for an unobservable Markov Decision Process the parameter is 0. Thus, the new parameter characterizes a spectrum from MDPs to unobservable MDPs depending on the amount of information conveyed in the observations.

    :abstractText: We study the stability properties of the dynamics of the standard continuous limit-order mechanism that is used in modern equity markets. We ask whether such mechanisms are susceptible to "buttery effects" --- the iniction of large changes on common measures of market activity by only small perturbations of the order sequence. We show that the answer depends strongly on whether the market consists of "absolute" traders (who determine their prices independent of the current order book state) or "relative" traders (who determine their prices relative to the current bid and ask). We prove that while the absolute trader model enjoys provably strong stability properties, the relative trader model is vulnerable to great instability. Our theoretical results are supported by large-scale experiments using limit order data from INET, a large electronic exchange for NASDAQ stocks.

    :abstractText: In an online linear optimization problem, on each period $t$, an online algorithm chooses $s_t\in\mathcal{S}$ from a fixed (possibly infinite) set $\mathcal{S}$ of feasible decisions. Nature (who may be adversarial) chooses a weight vector $w_t\in\mathbb{R}^n$, and the algorithm incurs cost $c(s_t,w_t)$, where $c$ is a fixed cost function that is linear in the weight vector. In the full-information setting, the vector $w_t$ is then revealed to the algorithm, and in the bandit setting, only the cost experienced, $c(s_t,w_t)$, is revealed. The goal of the online algorithm is to perform nearly as well as the best fixed $s\in\mathcal{S}$ in hindsight. Many repeated decision-making problems with weights fit naturally into this framework, such as online shortest-path, online traveling salesman problem (TSP), online clustering, and online weighted set cover. Previously, it was shown how to convert any efficient exact offline optimization algorithm for such a problem into an efficient online algorithm in both the full-information and the bandit settings, with average cost nearly as good as that of the best fixed $s\in\mathcal{S}$ in hindsight. However, in the case where the offline algorithm is an approximation algorithm with ratio $\alpha >1$, the previous approach worked only for special types of approximation algorithms. We show how to convert any offline approximation algorithm for a linear optimization problem into a corresponding online approximation algorithm, with a polynomial blowup in runtime. If the offline algorithm has an $\alpha$-approximation guarantee, then the expected cost of the online algorithm on any sequence is not much larger than $\alpha$ times that of the best $s\in\mathcal{S}$, where the best is chosen with the benefit of hindsight. Our main innovation is combining Zinkevich's algorithm for convex optimization with a geometric transformation that can be applied to any approximation algorithm. Standard techniques generalize the above result to the bandit setting, except that a &ldquo;barycentric spanner&rdquo; for the problem is also (provably) necessary as input. Our algorithm can also be viewed as a method for playing large repeated games, where one can compute only approximate best responses, rather than best responses.

    :abstractText: We provide a natural learning process in which the joint frequency of (time-averaged) empirical play converges into the set of convex combinations of Nash equilibria. Furthermore, the actual distribution of players' actions is close to some (approximate) Nash equilibria on most rounds (on all but a vanishing fraction of the rounds). In this process, all players rationally choose their actions using a public prediction made by a deterministic, weakly calibrated algorithm. For this to be possible, we show that such a deterministic (weakly) calibrated learning algorithm exists.

    :abstractText: Clustering data in high dimensions is believed to be a hard problem in general. A number of efficient clustering algorithms developed in recent years address this problem by projecting the data into a lower-dimensional subspace, e.g. via Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or random projections, before clustering. Here, we consider constructing such projections using multiple views of the data, via Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Under the assumption that the views are un-correlated given the cluster label, we show that the separation conditions required for the algorithm to be successful are significantly weaker than prior results in the literature. We provide results for mixtures of Gaussians and mixtures of log concave distributions. We also provide empirical support from audio-visual speaker clustering (where we desire the clusters to correspond to speaker ID) and from hierarchical Wikipedia document clustering (where one view is the words in the document and the other is the link structure).

    :abstractText: "We analyze the problem of designing a truthful pay-per-click auction where the click-through-rates (CTR) of the bidders are unknown to the auction. Such an auction faces the classic explore/exploit dilemma: while gathering information about the click through rates of advertisers, the mechanism may loose revenue; however, this gleaned information may prove valuable in the future for a more profitable allocation. In this sense, such mechanisms are prime candidates to be designed using multi-armed bandit techniques. However, a naive application of multi-armed bandit algorithms would not take into account the strategic considerations of the players -- players might manipulate their bids (which determine the auction's revenue) in a way as to maximize their own utility. Hence, we consider the natural restriction that the auction be truthful. The revenue that we could hope to achieve is the expected revenue of a Vickrey auction that knows the true CTRs, and we define the truthful regret to be the difference between the expected revenue of the auction and this Vickrey revenue. This work sharply characterizes what regret is achievable, under a truthful restriction. We show that this truthful restriction imposes statistical limits on the achievable regret -- the achievable regret is \xCE\x98(T2/3), while for traditional bandit algorithms (without the truthful restriction) the achievable regret is \xCE\x98(T1/2) (where T is the number of rounds). We term the extra T1/6 factor, the `price of truthfulness'."

    :abstractText: We consider a Markov decision process (MDP) setting in which the reward function is allowed to change after each time step (possibly in an adversarial manner), yet the dynamics remain fixed. Similar to the experts setting, we address the question of how well an agent can do when compared to the reward achieved under the best stationary policy over time. We provide efficient algorithms, which have regret bounds with no dependence on the size of state space. Instead, these bounds depend only on a certain horizon time of the process and logarithmically on the number of actions.

    :abstractText: Heuristics for the NP-complete problem of calculating the optimal phylogenetic tree for a set of aligned rRNA sequences based on the maximum likelihood method are computationallyexpensive. In most existing algorithms the tree evaluation and branch length optimization functions, calculating the likelihood value for each tree topology examined in the search space, account for the greatest part of overall computation time. This paper introduces AxML, a program derived from fastDNAml, incorporating a fast topology evaluation function. The algorithmic optimizations introduced, represent a general approach for accelerating thisfunction and are applicable to both sequential and parallel phylogeny programs, irrespective of their search space strategy. Therefore, their integration into three existing phylogeny programs rendered encouraging results. Experimental results on conventional processor architectures show a global run time improvement of 35% up to 47% for the various test sets and program versions we used.

    :abstractText: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with maximum likelihood is computationally intensive. In previous work we have introduced and implemented algorithmic optimizations in PAxML. The program shows run time improvements > 25% over parallel fastDNAml yielding exactly the same results. This paper is focusing on computations of large phylogenetic trees (> 100 organisms) with maximum likelihood. We propose a novel, partially randomized algorithm and new parsimony-based rearrangement heuristics, which are implemented in a sequential and parallel program called RAxML.We provide experimental results for real biological data containing 101 up to 1000 sequences and simulated data containing 150 to 500 sequences, which show run time improvements of factor 8 up to 31 over PAxML yielding equally good trees in terms of likelihood values and RF distance rates at the same time. Finally, we compare the performance of the sequential version of RAxML with a greater variety of available ML codes such as fastDNAml, AxML and MrBayes. RAxML is a freely available open source program.

    :abstractText: Heuristics for calculating phylogenetic trees for a large sets of aligned rRNA sequences based on the maximum likelihood method are computationally expensive. The core of most parallel algorithms, which accounts for the greatest part of computation time, is the tree evaluation function, that calculates the likelihood value for each tree topology. This paper describes and uses Subtree Equality Vectors (SEVs) to reduce the number of required floating point operations during topology evaluation.We integrated our optimizations into various sequential programs and into parallel fastDNAml, one of the most common and efficient parallel programs for calculating large phylogenetic trees.Experimental results for our parallel program, which renders exactly the same output as parallel fastDNAml show global run time improvements of 26% to 65%. The optimization scales best on clusters of PCs, which also implies a substantial cost saving factor for the determination of large trees.

    :abstractText: "Motivation: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with statistical models such as maximum likelihood or bayesian inference is computationally extremely intensive. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and computational complexity the size of trees which can be computed on a Biologist's PC workstation within reasonable time is limited to trees containing approximately 100 taxa. Results: In this paper we present the latest release of our program RAxML-III for rapid maximum likelihood-based inference of large evolutionary trees which allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours on a single PC processor. We compare RAxML-III to the currently fastest implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian inference: PHYML and MrBayes. Whereas RAxML-III performs worse than PHYML and MrBayes on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values. Availability Supplementary information: RAxML-III including all alignments and final trees mentioned in this paper is freely available as open source code at http://wwwbode.cs.tum/~stamatak Contact: stamatak@cs.tum.edu"

    :abstractText: Although getting notebook computers, cell phones, PDAs, and similar devices to work together can be frustrating today, these and other digital devices will eventually work in concert, like an ensemble of musicians that achieves a total effect greater than that of its individual performers.Some claim that all personal devices will disappear except for full-featured cell phones, which already have integrated cameras, PDAs, GPS tracking, and music players. In a future built around one device, some may think ensemble computing is a red herring.Yet people will always be motivated to build and use tools that feel natural. Although some capabilities will merge into adjacent form factors, such as personal information management merging into cell phones, other combinations will find a steady state. Familiar technosocial ensembles such as the PC workspace and home entertainment center are fairly generic and location-based. These are rapidly giving way to personalized mobile ensembles that rely heavily on portable devices and a user-centric model of communication and media engagement.

    :abstractText: "What type of algorithms and statistical techniques support learning from very large datasets over long stretches of time? We address this question through a memory bounded version of a variational EM algorithm that approximates inference in a topic model. The algorithm alternates two phases: \"model building\" and \"model compression\" in order to always satisfy a given memory constraint. The model building phase expands its internal representation (the number of topics) as more data arrives through Bayesian model selection. Compression is achieved by merging data-items in clumps and only caching their sufficient statistics. Empirically, the resulting algorithm is able to handle datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than the standard batch version."

    :abstractText: Energy harvesting offers a promising alternative to solve the sustainability limitations arising from battery size constraints in sensor networks. Several considerations in using an environmental energy source are fundamentally different from using batteries. Rather than a limit on the total energy, harvesting transducers impose a limit on the instantaneous power available. Further, environmental energy availability is often highly variable and a deterministic metric such as residual battery capacity is not available to characterize the energy source. The different nodes in a sensor network may also have different energy harvesting opportunities. Since the same end-user performance may be achieved using different workload allocations at multiple nodes, it is important to adapt the workload allocation to the spatio-temporal energy availability profile in order to enable energy-neutral operation of the network. This paper describes power management techniques for such energy harvesting sensor networks. Platform design considerations as well as power scaling techniques at the node-level and network-level are described.

    :abstractText: Sustainable operation of battery powered wireless embedded systems (such as sensor nodes) is a key challenge, and considerable research effort has been devoted to energy optimization of such systems. Environmental energy harvesting, in particular solar based, has emerged as a viable technique to supplement battery supplies. However, designing an efficient solar harvesting system to realize the potential benefits of energy harvesting requires an in-depth understanding of several factors. For example, solar energy supply is highly time varying and may not always be sufficient to power the embedded system. Harvesting components, such as solar panels, and energy storage elements, such as batteries or ultracapacitors, have different voltage-current characteristics, which must be matched to each other as well as the energy requirements of the system to maximize harvesting efficiency. Further, battery non-idealities, such as self-discharge and round trip efficiency, directly affect energy usage and storage decisions. The ability of the system to modulate its power consumption by selectively deactivating its sub-components also impacts the overall power management architecture. This paper describes key issues and tradeoffs which arise in the design of solar energy harvesting, wireless embedded systems and presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Heliomote, our prototype that addresses several of these issues. Experimental results demonstrate that Heliomote, which behaves as a plug-in to the Berkeley/Crossbow motes and autonomously manages energy harvesting and storage, enables near-perpetual, harvesting aware operation of the sensor node.

    :abstractText: FlashDB is a self-tuning database optimized for sensor networks using NAND flash storage. In practical systems flash is used in different packages such as on-board flash chips, compact flash cards, secure digital cards and related formats. Our experiments reveal non-trivial differences in their access costs. Furthermore, databases may be subject to different types of workloads. We show that existing databases for flash are not optimized for all types of flash devices or for all workloads and their performance is thus suboptimal in many practical systems. FlashDB uses a novel self-tuning index that dynamically adapts its storage structure to workload and underlying storage device. We formalize the self-tuning nature of an index as a two-state task system and propose a 3-competitive online algorithm that achieves the theoretical optimum. We also provide a framework to determine the optimal size of an index node that minimizes energy and latency for a given device. Finally, we propose optimizations to further improve the performance of our index. We prototype and compare different indexing schemes on multiple flash devices and workloads, and show that our indexing scheme outperforms existing schemes under all workloads and flash devices we consider.

    :abstractText: Energy constrained systems such as sensor networks can increase their usable lifetimes by extracting energy from their environment. However, environmental energy will typically not be spread homogeneously over the spread of the network. We argue that significant improvements in usable system lifetime can be achieved if the task allocation is aligned with the spatio-temporal characteristics of energy availability. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been addressed before. We present a distributed framework for the sensor network to adaptively learn its energy environment and give localized algorithms to use this information for task sharing among nodes. Our framework allows the system to exploit its energy resources more efficiently, thus increasing its lifetime. These gains are in addition to those from utilizing sleep modes and residual energy based scheduling mechanisms. Performance studies for an experimental energy environment show up to 200% improvement in lifetime.

    :abstractText: Harvesting energy from the environment is feasible in many applications to ameliorate the energy limitations in sensor networks. In this paper, we present an adaptive duty cycling algorithm that allows energy harvesting sensor nodes to autonomously adjust their duty cycle according to the energy availability in the environment. The algorithm has three objectives, namely (a) achieving energy neutral operation, i.e., energy consumption should not be more than the energy provided by the environment, (b) maximizing the system performance based on an application utility model subject to the above energy-neutrality constraint, and (c) adapting to the dynamics of the energy source at run-time. We present a model that enables harvesting sensor nodes to predict future energy opportunities based on historical data. We also derive an upper bound on the maximum achievable performance assuming perfect knowledge about the future behavior of the energy source. Our methods are evaluated using data gathered from a prototype solar energy harvesting platform and we show that our algorithm can utilize up to 58% more environmental energy compared to the case when harvesting-aware power management is not used.

    :abstractText: "Computer networks have historically considered support for mobile devices as an extra overhead to be borne by the system. Recently however, researchers have proposed methods by which the network can take advantage of mobile components. We exploit mobility to develop a fluid infrastructure: mobile components are deliberately built into the system infrastructure for enabling specific functionality that is very hard to achieve using other methods. Built-in intelligence helps our system adapt to run time dynamics when pursuing pre-defined performance objectives. Our approach yields significant advantages for energy constrained systems, sparsely deployed networks, delay tolerant networks, and in security sensitive situations. We first show why our approach is advantageous in terms of network lifetime and data fidelity. Second, we present adaptive algorithms that are used to control mobility. Third, we design the communication protocol supporting a fluid infrastructure and long sleep durations on energy-constrained devices. Our algorithms are not based on abstract radio range models or idealized unobstructed environments but founded on real world behavior of wireless devices. We implement a prototype system in which infrastructure components move autonomously to carry out important networking tasks. The prototype is used to validate and evaluate our suggested mobility control methods."

    :abstractText: The use of environmental energy is now emerging as a feasible energy source for embedded and wireless computing systems such as sensor networks where manual recharging or replacement of batteries is not practical. However, energy supply from environmental sources is highly variable with time. Further, for a distributed system, the energy available at its various locations will be different. These variations strongly influence the way in which environmental energy is used. We present a harvesting theory for determining performance in such systems. First we present a model for characterizing environmental sources. Second, we state and prove two harvesting theorems that help determine the sustainable performance level from a particular source. This theory leads to practical techniques for scheduling processes in energy harvesting systems. Third, we present our implementation of a real embedded system that runs on solar energy and uses our harvesting techniques. The system adjusts its performance level in response to available resources. Fourth, we propose a localized algorithm for increasing the performance of a distributed system by adapting the process scheduling to the spatio-temporal characteristics of the environmental energy in the distributed system. While our theoretical intuition is based on certain abstractions, all the scheduling methods we present are motivated solely from the experimental behavior and resource constraints of practical sensor networking systems.

    :abstractText: "Power management is an important concern in sensor networks, because a tethered energy infrastructure is usually not available and an obvious concern is to use the available battery energy efficiently. However, in some of the sensor networking applications, an additional facility is available to ameliorate the energy problem: harvesting energy from the environment. Certain considerations in using an energy harvesting source are fundamentally different from that in using a battery, because, rather than a limit on the maximum energy, it has a limit on the maximum rate at which the energy can be used. Further, the harvested energy availability typically varies with time in a nondeterministic manner. While a deterministic metric, such as residual battery, suffices to characterize the energy availability in the case of batteries, a more sophisticated characterization may be required for a harvesting source. Another issue that becomes important in networked systems with multiple harvesting nodes is that different nodes may have different harvesting opportunity. In a distributed application, the same end-user performance may be achieved using different workload allocations, and resultant energy consumptions at multiple nodes. In this case, it is important to align the workload allocation with the energy availability at the harvesting nodes. We consider the above issues in power management for energy-harvesting sensor networks. We develop abstractions to characterize the complex time varying nature of such sources with analytically tractable models and use them to address key design issues. We also develop distributed methods to efficiently use harvested energy and test these both in simulation and experimentally on an energy-harvesting sensor network, prototyped for this work."

    :abstractText: We discuss the use of mobility to enhance network performance for a certain class of applications in sensor networks. A major performance bottleneck in sensor networks is energy since it is impractical to replace the batteries in embedded sensor nodes post-deployment. A significant portion of the energy expenditure is attributed to communications and, in particular, the nodes close to the sensor network gateways used for data collection typically suffer a large overhead as these nodes must relay data from the remaining network. Even with compression and in-network processing to reduce the amount of communicated data, all the processed data must still traverse these nodes to reach the gateway. We discuss a network infrastructure based on the use of controllably mobile elements to reduce the communication energy consumption at the energy constrained nodes and, thus, increase useful network lifetime. In addition, our approach yields advantages in delay-tolerant networks and sparsely deployed networks. We first show how our approach helps reduce energy consumption at battery constrained nodes. Second, we describe our system prototype which utilizes our proposed approach to improve the energy performance. As part of the prototyping effort, we experienced several interesting design choices and trade-offs that affect system capabilities and performance. We describe many of these design challenges and discuss the algorithms developed for addressing these. In particular, we focus on network protocols and motion control strategies. Our methods are tested using a practical system and do not assume idealistic radio range models or operation in unobstructed environments.

    :abstractText: Shared sensing infrastructures that allow multiple applications to share deployed sensors are emerging and Internet protocol based access for such sensors has already been prototyped and deployed. As a large number of applications start accessing shared sensors, the efficiency of resource usage at the embedded nodes and in the network infrastructure supporting them becomes a concern. To address this, we develop methods that detect when common data and common stream processing is requested by multiple applications, including cases where only some of the data is shared or only intermediate processing steps are common. The communication and processing is then modified to eliminate the redundancies. Specifically, we use an interval-cover graph to minimize communication redundancies and a joint data flow graph optimization to remove computational redundancies. Both methods operate online and allow application requests to be dynamically added or removed. The proposed methods are evaluated using applications on a road traffic sensing infrastructure.

    :abstractText: "Cloud computing offers users the ability to access large pools of computational and storage resources on demand. Multiple commercial clouds already allow businesses to replace, or supplement, privately owned IT assets, alleviating them from the burden of managing and maintaining these facilities. However, there are issues that must be addressed before this vision of utility computing can be fully realized. In existing systems, customers are charged based upon the amount of resources used or reserved, but no guarantees are made regarding the application level performance or quality-of-service (QoS) that the given resources will provide. As cloud providers continue to utilize virtualization technologies in their systems, this can become problematic. In particular, the consolidation of multiple customer applications onto multicore servers introduces performance interference between collocated workloads, significantly impacting application QoS. To address this challenge, we advocate that the cloud should transparently provision additional resources as necessary to achieve the performance that customers would have realized if they were running in isolation. Accordingly, we have developed Q-Clouds, a QoS-aware control framework that tunes resource allocations to mitigate performance interference effects. Q-Clouds uses online feedback to build a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model that captures performance interference interactions, and uses it to perform closed loop resource management. In addition, we utilize this functionality to allow applications to specify multiple levels of QoS as application Q-states. For such applications, Q-Clouds dynamically provisions underutilized resources to enable elevated QoS levels, thereby improving system efficiency. Experimental evaluations of our solution using benchmark applications illustrate the benefits: performance interference is mitigated completely when feasible, and system utilization is improved by up to 35% using Q-states."

    :abstractText: Compressive sensing (CS) is an emerging field that provides a framework for image recovery using sub-Nyquist sampling rates. The CS theory shows that a signal can be reconstructed from a small set of random projections, provided that the signal is sparse in some basis, e.g., wavelets. In this paper, we describe a method to directly recover background subtracted images using CS and discuss its applications in some communication constrained multi-camera computer vision problems. We show how to apply the CS theory to recover object silhouettes (binary background subtracted images) when the objects of interest occupy a small portion of the camera view, i.e., when they are sparse in the spatial domain. We cast the background subtraction as a sparse approximation problem and provide different solutions based on convex optimization and total variation. In our method, as opposed to learning the background, we learn and adapt a low dimensional compressed representation of it, which is sufficient to determine spatial innovations; object silhouettes are then estimated directly using the compressive samples without any auxiliary image reconstruction. We also discuss simultaneous appearance recovery of the objects using compressive measurements. In this case, we show that it may be necessary to reconstruct one auxiliary image. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we provide results on data captured using a compressive single-pixel camera. We also illustrate that our approach is suitable for image coding in communication constrained problems by using data captured by multiple conventional cameras to provide 2D tracking and 3D shape reconstruction results with compressive measurements.

    :abstractText: We develop a theory to predict the localization performance of randomly distributed sensor networks consisting of various sensor modalities when only a constant active subset of sensors that minimize localization error is used for estimation. The characteristics of the modalities include measurement type (bearing or range) and error, sensor reliability, FOV, sensing range, and mobility. We show that the localization performance of a sensor network is a function of a weighted sum of the total number of each sensor modality. We also show that optimization of this weighted sum is independent of how the sensor management strategy chooses the active sensors. We combine the utility objective with other objectives, such as lifetime, coverage and reliability to determine the best mix of sensors for an optimal sensor network design. The Pareto efficient frontier of the multi objectives are obtained with a dynamic program, which also accommodates additional convex constraints.

    :abstractText: "Compressive sensing (CS) is an alternative to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for the acquisition of sparse or compressible signals that can be well approximated by just K \xE2\x89\xAA N elements from an N-dimensional basis. Instead of taking periodic samples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS dictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log (N/K)) measurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing robustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple sparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the values and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a model-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides concrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with provable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class of structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for robust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted amplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted isometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant signal models--wavelet trees and block sparsity--into two state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M = O(K) measurements. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the validity and applicability of our new theory and algorithms."

    :abstractText: Decentralized processing algorithms are attractive alternatives to centralized algorithms for target tracking applications in smart sensor networks since they provide the ability to scale, reduce vulnerability, reduce communication, and share processing responsibilities among individual nodes. Sharing the processing responsibilities allows parallel processing of raw data at the individual nodes. However, this introduces other difficulties in multi-modal smart sensor networks, such as non-observability of the targets' states at any individual node and various delays such as varying processing delays, communication delays and signal propagation delays for the different modalities. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm to determine the initial probability distribution of multiple targets' states in a decentralized manner. The targets' state vectors consist of the targets' positions and velocities on the 2D plane. Our approach can determine the state vector distribution even if the individual sensors alone are not capable of observing it. Our approach can also compensate for varying delays among the assorted modalities. The resulting distribution can be used to initialize various tracking algorithms. Our approach is based on Monte Carlo methods, where the state distributions are represented by a weighted set of discrete state realizations. A robust weighting strategy is formulated to account for missed detections, clutter and estimation delays. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, we simulate a network with direction-of-arrival nodes and range-Doppler nodes.

    :abstractText: In this article, we develop tractable mathematical models and approximate solution algorithms for a class of integer optimization problems with probabilistic and deterministic constraints, with applications to the design of distributed sensor networks that have limited connectivity. For a given deployment region size, we calculate the Pareto frontier of the sensor network utility at the desired probabilities for d-connectivity and k-coverage. As a result of our analysis, we determine (1) the number of sensors of different types to deploy from a sensor pool, which offers a cost vs. performance trade-off for each type of sensor, (2) the minimum required radio transmission ranges of the sensors to ensure connectivity, and (3) the lifetime of the sensor network. For generality, we consider randomly deployed sensor networks and formulate constrained optimization technique to obtain the localization performance. The approach is guided and validated using an unattended acoustic sensor network design. Finally, approximations of the complete statistical characterization of the acoustic sensor networks are given, which enable average network performance predictions of any combination of acoustic sensors.

    :abstractText: We estimate a vehicle's speed, its wheelbase length, and tire track length by jointly estimating its acoustic wave pattern with a single passive acoustic sensor that records the vehicle's drive-by noise. The acoustic wave pattern is determined using the vehicle's speed, the Doppler shift factor, the sensor's distance to the vehicle's closest-point-of-approach, and three envelope shape (ES) components, which approximate the shape variations of the received signal's power envelope. We incorporate the parameters of the ES components along with estimates of the vehicle engine RPM, the number of cylinders, and the vehicle's initial bearing, loudness and speed to form a vehicle profile vector. This vector provides a fingerprint that can be used for vehicle identification and classification. We also provide possible reasons why some of the existing methods are unable to provide unbiased vehicle speed estimates using the same framework. The approach is illustrated using vehicle speed estimation and classification results obtained with field data.

    :abstractText: This paper exploits recent developments in sparse approximation and compressive sensing to efficiently perform localization in a sensor network. We introduce a Bayesian framework for the localization problem and provide sparse approximations to its optimal solution. By exploiting the spatial sparsity of the posterior density, we demonstrate that the optimal solution can be computed using fast sparse approximation algorithms. We show that exploiting the signal sparsity can reduce the sensing and computational cost on the sensors, as well as the communication bandwidth. We further illustrate that the sparsity of the source locations can be exploited to decentralize the computation of the source locations and reduce the sensor communications even further. We also discuss how recent results in 1-bit compressive sensing can significantly reduce the amount of inter-sensor communications by transmitting only the intrinsic timing information. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient algorithm for bearing estimation using a network of sensors with provable guarantees.

    :abstractText: Conceptual modeling is a core activity within information systems analysis and design. In response to continuous criticisms targeting the foundation of conceptual modeling, the notion of ontology as a theoretical reference has gained immense popularity over recent decades. At the forefront of these ontology-based theories is the Bunge-Wand-Weber representation model, which has frequently been applied in conceptual modeling research, most notably to the task of evaluating conceptual Information Systems analysis and design models and modeling grammars. Recently, however, ontology-based theories themselves have been subjected to criticisms, in particular in respect to their epistemological presuppositions. In our paper we address the question of epistemology in conceptual modeling research based on ontological theories, and argue that there is an immanent need for publishing the epistemological assumptions of these theories in order to be able to critically evaluate boundaries, scope and limits of these theories for conceptual modeling. We present a discussion framework that facilitates the analysis of epistemological viewpoints and their implications. We apply this framework to the commonly known Bunge-Wand-Weber model and discuss the implications of our findings towards the feasibility of ontology as a reference theory for conceptual modeling.

    :abstractText: "`Open Innovation' has been heavily discussed for product innovations; however, an information systems (IS) perspective on `process innovation' has not yet been taken. Analyzing the example of the public sector in Germany, the paper seeks to investigate the factors that hinder and support `open process innovation', a concept we define as the involvement of citizens in business process management (BPM) activities. With the help of a quantitative study (n=358), six factors are examined for their impact on citizen involvement in local government BPM initiatives. The results show that citizen involvement in reform processes is not primarily motivated by the aim of cost reduction, but rather related to legitimacy reasons and the intent to increase employee motivation. Based on these findings, implications for (design) theory and practice are discussed: Instead of detailed collaborative business processes modeling, the key of citizen involvement in public sector BPM lies in communication and mutual understanding."

    :abstractText: The issue of digital divide is widely discussed in both research and practice. The ministers of the European Union agreed to bridge this divide and form an inclusive information society. However, up to now especially senior citizens are still excluded from using ICT. Hence, this study aims at clarifying whether e-Government has reacted on the age-related digital divide. With the help of a structured methodology, we select and analyze 71 cities in Austria and Switzerland for their existing initiatives to bridge this divide. The results show that relevant projects have been started and that best practices exist.

    :abstractText: "The development of socially-aware eGovernment policies requires the implementation of multiple delivery channels to give the different user categories the choice of which service access alternatives (physical and electronic) to use each time. The paper claims that new intermediaries play a potentially significant role in inclusive eGovernment strategies, in both the developed and the developing countries. A selective review of the disparate literature highlights the need for a better understanding of the role of these actors and their impacts on the qualities of the citizens' and public-sector relationships. Our exploratory research suggests the usefulness of placing the intermediaries in an institutional framework and proposes an agenda for future research.

    :abstractText: We present a framework for efficient, accurate approximate Bayesian inference in generalized linear models (GLMs), based on the expectation propagation (EP) technique. The parameters can be endowed with a factorizing prior distribution, encoding properties such as sparsity or non-negativity. The central role of posterior log-concavity in Bayesian GLMs is emphasized and related to stability issues in EP. In particular, we use our technique to infer the parameters of a point process model for neuronal spiking data from multiple electrodes, demonstrating significantly superior predictive performance when a sparsity assumption is enforced via a Laplace prior distribution.

    :abstractText: Approximate Bayesian Gaussian process (GP) classification techniques are powerful non-parametric learning methods, similar in appearance and performance to support vector machines. Based on simple probabilistic models, they render interpretable results and can be embedded in Bayesian frameworks for model selection, feature selection, etc. In this paper, by applying the PAC-Bayesian theorem of McAllester (1999a), we prove distribution-free generalisation error bounds for a wide range of approximate Bayesian GP classification techniques. We also provide a new and much simplified proof for this powerful theorem, making use of the concept of convex duality which is a backbone of many machine learning techniques. We instantiate and test our bounds for two particular GPC techniques, including a recent sparse method which circumvents the unfavourable scaling of standard GP algorithms. As is shown in experiments on a real-world task, the bounds can be very tight for moderate training sample sizes. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the tightest known distribution-free error bounds for approximate Bayesian GPC methods, giving a strong learning-theoretical justification for the use of these techniques.

    :abstractText: We show how model checking methods developed for hybrid dynamic systems may be usefully applied for analog circuit verification. Finite-state abstractions of the continuous analog behavior are automatically constructed using polyhedral outer approximations to the flows of the underlying continuous differential and difference equations. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not discretize the entire continuous state space, and our abstraction captures the relevant behaviors for verification in terms of the transitions between "states" (regions of the continuous state space) as a finite state machine in the hybrid system model. The approach is illustrated for two circuits, a standard oscillator benchmark, and a much larger and more realistic delta-sigma (AI) modulator.

    :abstractText: Analytical models intend to reveal inner structure, dynamics, or relationship of things. However, they are not necessarily intuitive to humans. Conventional scientific visualization methods are intuitive, but limited by depth, dimension, and resolution. The purpose of this study is to bridge the gap with transformation algorithms for mapping the data from an abstract space to an intuitive one, which include shape correlation, periodicity, multiphysics, and spatial Bayesian. We tested this approach with the oceanographic case study. We found that the interactive visualization increases robustness in object tracking and positive detection accuracy in object prediction. We also found that the interactive method enables the user to process the image data at less than 1 min per image versus 30 min per image manually. As a result, our test system can handle at least 10 times more data sets than traditional manual analyses. The results also suggest that minimal human interactions with appropriate computational transformations or cues may significantly increase the overall productivity.

    :abstractText: Recent advances in computing have led to an explosion in the amount of data being generated. Processing the ever-growing data in a timely manner has made throughput computing an important aspect for emerging applications. Our analysis of a set of important throughput computing kernels shows that there is an ample amount of parallelism in these kernels which makes them suitable for today's multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups (between 10X and 1000X) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the performance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7-960 processor narrows to only 2.5x on average. In this paper, we discuss optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU, analyze what architecture features contributed to performance differences between the two architectures, and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in architectural efficiency for throughput kernels.

    :abstractText: A system test of various components of the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) detector, operating in concert, has recently come on-line. Communication between a major sub-detector, a sector of the time projection chamber (TPC), and the trigger, data acquisition and slow controls systems has been established, enabling data from cosmic ray muons to be collected. First results from an analysis of the TPC data are presented. These include measurements of system noise, electronic parameters such as amplifier gains and pedestal values, and tracking resolution for cosmic ray muons and laser induced ionization tracks. A discussion on the experience gained in integrating the different components for the system test is also given

    :abstractText: Logical key tree is an important issue for multicast key management. The degree of a tree and the algorithm which maintains the balance has great effect on the multicast key management. The paper makes an analysis on the key tree degree with using hierarchical data processing model. The complete quad tree is taken as the logical structure of the key management, and the rebuilding algorithm of a complete logical key tree is based on the idea of subtree movement so that the external cost which caused by the tree balancing can be reduced. This paper gives the designing idea, analyzes and devises the realization algorithms, and constructs a practical complete tree key management scheme. The analysis shows that this scheme is simple to realize and the cost is still low, being applicable to the situation where the group size is enormous and the changing of the group is frequent.

    :abstractText: Improvements at the physical network layer have enabled technologies such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Single core end-systems are unable to fully utilize these networks, due to limited clock cycles. Using a Multi-core architecture is one method which increases the number of available cycles, and thus allow networks to be fully utilized. However, using these systems creates a new set of challenges for network protocol processing, for example, deciding how best to utilize many cores for high network performance.This paper examines different ways the cores of a multi-core system can be utilized, and, by experimentation, we show that in an eight core system deciding which cores to use is important. In one test, there was a 40% discrepancy in CPU utilization depending on which cores were used. This discrepancy results from the resources each core shares, an example being the multi-hierarchy CPU caches, and to which bus the processors are connected.
